            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I haue receaued your Letter,<note place="margin">The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> togeather with a little Lattin Booke, or rather a Preface to our fugitiue Biſhop dated at <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; printed in <hi>London.</hi> In my mynd you wilbe able to make no other vſe of him, but only to ſhew him for a tyme vp and downe the ſtreets: and after that, he may ſerue you for a ſtale to publiſh more Bookes in his name. For giuing him his diet, and ſome other ſmall contentment, you may do with him what you pleaſe. In which reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I thinke he may be fitly ſurnamed <hi>Monſignor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7997:6"/>fate voi:</hi> wherof euery one that hath been in Italy may be able to giue you the reaſon, by recounting vnto you the Originall ſtory of this application. But if you ſuffer him to write himſelfe, or that the Booke he promiſeth, come forth as it came from him; though it were as big as the horſe of <hi>Troy,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning in it an innumerable number of our errours, beſides the Confutation of them, as he pretendeth: and though it were longer a making,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.14.21.</note> then the warre of <hi>Tray</hi> indured, as himſelfe confeſſeth: yet in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as he hath ſhamed himſelfe already, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Countrey; ſo will he ſhame you alſo by his comming thither. Which I am bold to ſay, becauſe in this his firſt peece, which he hath expoſed to your view like a greene Buſh, for the ſale of his new wyne, euery body may eaſily ſee the Diuell ſitting. And in thoſe few degrees, which he maketh of the courſe of his Conuerſion, he diſcouereth ſo many vices, that it cannot be denyed, the way he tooke could no more bring him to the knowledge of the truth, then the fall of Lucifer could end in heauen. Which, to giue you ſome taſt of the mans wyne, and ſome knowledg of that which hereafter may be expected from him, I will take the paines to ſhew vnto you, out of his owne words, and out of the ſeuerall paſſages of the booke you ſent me, which for this time I will ſuppoſe to be his owne, without any addition or alteration, by ſuch a ſpeciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as now a dayes is not vſually giuen or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>His meaning therfore, and ſcope therein, is only to proue (as he profeſſeth) that his ſodayne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7997:6"/>flight from <hi>Venice,</hi> which he calleth his <hi>Profection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops booke.</note> and change of place in going for England, was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the vocation of Almighty God: intending by this diſcourſe to preuent, in time, thoſe ſtormes of falſe imputations <q>(as he ſaith) that are like to come vpon him: Not that he feareth any thing (if yee will belieue him) but leaſt it might hinder the fruit of good edification in ſome, and occaſion ſome others to take ſcandall therat. Wherfore he is now pleaſed to reueale the <hi>Secrets</hi> of his <hi>Counſells,</hi>
               </q> and writeth this booke to iuſtify the ſame; and to make it ſo manifeſt vnto the world that God himſelfe was the Authour of it, as that no indifferent Reader ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be able to doubt therof; and they that will preſume to write againſt it, being ſo fully anſwered before hand, ſhalbe wholy confounded by this Apology.</p>
            <p>The old Prouerb ſaith, it is good to expect the lame Poſt, and the laſt newes are euer trueſt. In the meane time, the Biſhop excuſing himſelfe before he be accuſed, which is an ill ſigne; &amp; ſetting that good face vpon the matter which you haue ſeene; and knowing, as he ſaith, that we ought not to belieue euery ſpirit, but that <hi>ſpirits</hi> muſt be <hi>tryed</hi> according to S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> he putteth himſelfe to the tryall of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 4.</note> and ſeemeth to proue his <hi>Vocation</hi> and <hi>Profection</hi> to haue proceeded from the Spirit of God. Firſt Negatiuely, becauſe it could not proceed from any other. And ſecondly Affirmatiuely, by ſome other reaſon. His Negatiue proofes are two. The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth in his <hi>probationibus</hi> pag. 4. and endeth with <hi>Curergo</hi> pag. 5. <q>And briefly it is this in effect. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in this probation and triall of ſpirit full ten
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7997:7"/>yeares togeather, I neuer aduiſed nor ſpake with any mortall man about it; nor euer read any Authour againſt the Roman doctrine, whome I deteſted all that while <hi>(ſupra modum)</hi> aboue meaſure: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this change of mynd neuer came from man. But on the other ſide during all this long ſpace of time, I gouerned my thoughts, by thoſe rules of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which the holy Ghoſt hath ſet downe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by the Fathers: Therfore I haue no cauſe to ſuſpect it came from an euill ſpirit: And therfore it came from the ſpirit of God.</q> I will not ſtand to ſhew the inſufficiency of the conſequence. But I would haue you begin to obſerue, how contrary to that which he pretended, he ſeemeth now altogeather to neglect his Reader, who ſhould haue been edified: and as you will perceiue more plainely anone, he laboureth as it were to ſatify himſelfe: And which is a ſtrange thing, ſeemeth to haue publiſhed a Book to perſuade himſelf alone of the truth of the matter. Marke therfore, I beſeech you, how with this firſt argument of his, conſiſting of 2. parts as he ſets it downe, he ſo concludeth, as he leaueth his Reader altogeather a ſtranger to the truth of either. For who knoweth but himſelfe with whome he ſpake, what he read, and what rules he obſerued? And if the reſt of his proofes be ſuch as theſe, ſurely in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it had been better for him, that men ſhould haue truſted him ſtill, with their courteous conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the cauſe of his comming, rather then by meanes of this Booke, firſt to bring the matter in queſtion, and afterwards for iuſtification therof to take vp in great, all that he ſaith, vpon the courteſy of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7997:7"/>his Readers credit: and to ſet the truth of this whole booke vpon his ſcore of Truſt. But eſpecially in the latter part of his argument he was much to blame; wherein he proueth that his change proceded from the ſpirit of God, becauſe he obſerued thoſe rules for the triall of ſpirit which the holy Ghoſt hath left in Scripture. For if his proofe be not all one, it is at the leaſt no leſſe vncertayne then the thing he proueth euen to himſelf, as euery Reader may eaſily perceiue. And therfore to perſwade his friends, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the leaſt is well perſwaded of it, he ſhould haue declared, what rules of Scripture they were that he obſerued, which perchance would haue troubled him more, then his great booke with the 10. hornes, which was no leſſe then 10. whole yeares a making. But this man, hauing loſt his credit at home, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new come into a ſtrange Countrey, taketh vp all vpon truſt without pawne, or ſurety; which is another point wherein he alſo reſembleth <hi>Monſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor fate voi.</hi> And in the end withall his borrowing like vnto his predeceſſour, he may chance, though in another kind, to be well beaten for his labour.</p>
            <p>And now I might here diſpute, how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the ſtory is which he telleth, and how groſſe the inuention which he ſeeketh to put vpon you; That hauing no knowledge of your doctrine ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Speach, or Reading any of your bookes, he ſhould fall iuſt vpon your Parlamentall Religion. For firſt both <hi>Geneua,</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> were in his way; and ſuppoſing that the Engliſh Angells might haue more power with him, then the poore Guardian ſpirits of thoſe other Countryes. Secondly, I might
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7997:8"/>obiect his vehement ſuſpition (wherof he ſpeaketh pag. 8.) That Catholike Authours did not faithfully deliuer the opinions of the Proteſtants againſt whom they wrote: Which if it be true, no man can tell, how poſſibly he ſhould know, what points they held, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in England, or in any other Countrey againſt the Church of Rome. Wherof it would follow, that at his comming from <hi>Venice,</hi> he could only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Romane Religion was falſe, and that all other were ſufficiently true; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he reſolued to carry his ſheres with him, and to cut out his Religion, according to the faſhion of the Countrey where he came. In the meane time forſaking his former fayth, which though neuer ſo white, his owne pride and malice againſt the Pope made him thinke to be black, and bedecking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the party-coloured feathers of all other moderne Religions, to be the better welcome in all places;<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>15.</hi>
               </note> we ſhall plucke him anone like Eſops crow, and ſhew him to be naked without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all; as you will ſee heereafter. But for the preſent, letting his ſtrange conuerſion paſſe for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Myracle, that which I lay hold on at this tyme, and whereupon I muſt inſiſt a little, before I go any further, is the firſt part of his Argument, wherein he calleth God and his conſcience to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; That the perſuaſion of no mortall man, of any ſort, <q>came euer to his eaves, which might moue him to this determination; That no man at any time, did euer inuite him to it; That he vſed the counſell of none at all, nor euer conferred or ſpake with any man about it;<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> That he neuer read any Proteſtant
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7997:8"/>booke; And that if any Roman Prelate deteſted ſuch bookes, he deteſted them aboue meaſure.</q> For if this be true, then, ſay I, that hereof it wil euidently follow, that he was deluded by the Diuell, and was not directed by the ſpirit of God, as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. And ſo without any more ado, as our Sauiour ſayd of the wicked ſeruant, Out of his owne mouth you may condemne him. For the firſt part of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ouerthroweth not only the ſecond, but alſo the principall concluſion of his whole booke, and ſheweth that the alteration he hath made, could not proceed from God. Which now I will proue vnto you by three arguments, very plaine, and in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion moſt conuincing.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> The Bishop his firſt Reaſon turned againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And from thence are deduced three arguments, which do plainly proue, that he was deluded by the Diuell.</head>
               <p>BVT firſt you muſt note, that being in <hi>Venice,</hi> if he had liſted to conferre, he could not haue wanted ſufficient meanes, and choice of men, with whome he might haue treated moſt ſecurely. For beſids al Catholike Deuines, with whome he might haue dealt in Confeſſion, and vnder the ſeale of ſecreſy, there were others inough of his owne hayre, both Italians and ſtrangers, and ſome alſo of our owne Nation, <hi>Qui ſe putant aliquid eſſe,</hi> by whoſe acquaintance alſo, he might haue procured
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7997:9"/>bookes of al your Authours, out of <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And perchance in thoſe declining parts, vnder the State of Venice, there be too many of ſuch bookes already. Suppoſing therfore (which cannot be denied) that he might eaſily haue gotten both men and bookes, if he would (as they ſay) but haue wiſhed for them; out of his owne mouth againſt himſelfe, and againſt the ſpirit that brought him thither, I reaſon thus:</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of God is the ſpirit of wiſdome, in which reſpect Goodnes in Scripture is tearmed the Wiſdome of God, as Vice on the contrary is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Folly: And therfore ſuch as are gouerned by the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.12.</note> are gouerned by wiſdome, and by the rules of wiſdome ſet down in Scripture. But <hi>Wiſdom dwelleth in Counſell,</hi> according whereunto it was propheſied of our Sauiour, who is the wiſdom of his Father,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20.</note> And who knoweth not, that one of the principall gifts of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is called <hi>Donum Conſilij?</hi> Which is nothing els, but a certaine effect of his grace in the harts of al his children, wherby they are aptly diſpoſed to receiue ſpirituall aduice, and wholeſom counſell. Whereof it followeth, that the Biſhop, who ſo much deſpiſed all kind of counſell, in this his probation of ſpirit, could not be gouerned by the ſpirit of God, nor by the rules of wiſedome ſet downe in Scripture.

But by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth ſufficiently, that he hath not followed thoſe rules of diſcerning ſpirits, which with a little humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he might haue learned in Scripture.

               <p>And now, becauſe Pryde is nothing els, but a vice of the mynd, whereby one preſumeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more then he ought, and magnifying himſelfe diſpiſeth others; and that the greateſt Pryde of all, conſiſteth in an ouerwening conceit of ones owne vnderſtanding, proper wit, and priuate Iudgment; therefore the Biſhop in his owne wordes, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe deeply of the ſinne of pryde; which as it is the roote of other vices in generall, ſo hath it euer been the very Mother, and Dam of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in particuler. For beſides the impertiment narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his learned Lectures, and labourious life among the Ieſuites: of his aduancement to be made a Biſhop, an Archbiſhop, &amp; Primate of 2. ſtraung Kingdomes: of his Eccleſiaſticall Common wealth, which he paynteth out in many pages of his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (wherein he thinketh to excell all other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant writers, whome he vouchſafeth not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and which he hopeth, like another <hi>Leutathan,</hi> ſhall be able to drinke vp Iordan, and to ouerthrow the Popes Supremacy:) Of his pretence to be ſent from God to iudge, to reforme, and to reunite the chriſtian world.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7997:10"/>to ſound a tryumph before the victory; to let paſſe likewiſe how finally he likeneth himſelfe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in leauing at the voyce of God, his houſe, his parentage, and his countrey: Wherein he would giue vs to vnderſtand, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> preuented with his heroyicall act, that excellent ſaying of the heathen, <hi>Sequere Deum;</hi> ſo he in this our age, hath notably reuiued the ſame: Forſaking <hi>Dalmatia</hi> his noble Countrey, to liue heere in England amongſt barbarous people, for ſo I muſt needs vnderſtand him page 27. where <hi>he confideth, that as God rewarded Abraham with the preſeruation of the Chaſtity of his beautifull wife in the hands of</hi> Pharao: <hi>ſo alſo he will preſerue the beauty of his good name vntouched and vnſpotted, euen in the hands of barbarous people, to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie them, and not to ſuffer them to be ſcandalized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> To omit all this, and likewiſe to let paſſe, how familiarly he compareth himſelfe with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his former zeale againſt the true religion (as he ſayth:) in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of his conuerſion miraculouſly effected: in receiuing his Ghoſpell, as he would haue it ſeem not from man, but imediatly from God: in being an vniuerſall Apoſtle, as he pretendeth, and ſent to preach to al Nations: And laſtly, in that high degree of Charity, whereby he offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be made <hi>anathema</hi> for his brethren, which the Fathers ſo much admired, but could not imitate: permitting I ſay all theſe impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inſinuations of his owne excellency, which for the moſt part are brought in by head &amp; ſhoulders, and ſerue nothing to the purpoſe; I come to the poynt which I haue in hand. Wherein let any man be iudge, whether it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7997:11"/>were not a ſtrang kind of arrogancy, and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Pride in him, that wauering in his Faith for more then ten years ſpace, and all that while ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing controuerſies, and intending to turne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, as he did, he neuer vouchſafed to read any one Proteſtant authour, or to conferre with any mortall man about it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore hauing made his owne pride ſo manifeſt, and notorious to all the world, I frame my ſecond argument againſt the ſpirit that moued him to change Religion in this manner. The ſpirit that giueth true faith, is the ſpirit of Humility. Which is teſtified by our Sauiour, where he ſayth: <hi>vnles you become little children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1.</note>

                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> And to the ſame purpoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth alſo admoniſh, <hi>that if any man thinke himſelfe wiſe, he ſhould become a foole, that he might be made wiſe.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, not to pretend the <hi>knowledg of high thinges,</hi>

Therfore the ſpirit that moued the Biſhop to turne his Faith and chang religion, could not be the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7997:11"/>
               <p>Which Argument, to make the matter more euident, may be framed in this manner. The ſpirit of pride, not permitting a man to ſubiect his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to he taught by others, is the ſpirit of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy: And the reaſon is, becauſe Faith is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe thinges, which do far ſurpaſſe all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane vnderſtanding; and therfore before we come to beleeue, we muſt acknowledge our owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and <hi>captiuate our owne iudgment,</hi> ſubmitting the ſame, to obey thoſe that are appointed to inſtruct vs. For which reaſon our Sauiour told the Iewes that they <hi>could not beleeue, becauſe they ſought glory one of another:</hi> That is to ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5.44.</note> becauſe deſiring the chief prayſe of knowledge aboue others, they could not ſubmit themſelues to beleeue another.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.2.</note> And <hi>S.

And therefore els where deſcribing an Heretike, he affirmeth that he is <hi>proud and knoweth nothing:</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he knew nothing,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4.</note> becauſe he was proud So that you ſee, in what ſenſe it may be truly ſayd, that the ſpirit of Pride is the ſpirit of Hereſy. And as it blindeth the vnderſtanding, and with-holdeth the ſame from confeſſing his owne ignorance, and from ſubmitting it ſelfe to beleeue Gods word, as it is taught by others: ſo it expoſeth and putteth men forth to teach, and to make profeſſion of that which they neuer learned.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>They will be Doctours of the law</hi> (ſayth S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>neither vnderſtanding what they ſay; nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7997:12"/>whereof they affirme.</hi> In which ſenſe one ſayd very well of Heretiks, that<note n="(a)" place="margin">Fulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Carno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis Epiſt. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>while they refuſe to become diſciples or ſchollers of the truth, they make themſelues the maiſters of errour.</hi> And that which <hi>Optatus</hi> wrot of <hi>Victor</hi> may be alſo affirmed of other Heretikes,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Opt. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note>

               <p>No meruaile therfore, that the Biſhop ſeeming vnto himſelfe to be a man of ſo great and perfect vnderſtanding, as not to need the help of others, could not penetrate the deuine miſteryes conteyned in Scripture. For Almighty God is ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing to ſuch as are proud the ſecrets of his grace, that he is playnely ſayd to oppoſe himſelfe againſt them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iac.</hi> 4.6.</note> And our Sauiour thanketh his Father for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealing his ſecrets from them:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I thanke thee Father</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that thou hast hidden theſe things from the wiſe and prudent</hi> (in their one conceit) <hi>and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed them to little ones</hi> (ſuch as wilbe content to be inſtructed.) Yea though his firſt comming were in all mercy:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 9.39.40, 41.</note> yet againſt ſuch kind of perſons, he affirmeth that he came to iudgment, ſaying: <hi>I came into this world to do iudgment, that ſuch as ſee not</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their owne ignorance) <hi>might ſee and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:</hi> and that thoſe who ſee (preſuming v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their owne priuate vnderſtanding) might be made blind with their owne folly. And when the Iewes asked him therupon, whether they were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7997:12"/>blind, or no, he anſwered vnto them: <hi>If you were blind</hi> (acknowledging your owne blindnes) <hi>you ſhould haue no ſinne,</hi> becauſe your blyndnes ſhould haue been forgiuen you.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.17</note> 
                  <hi>But now ſaying that you ſee,</hi> (not acknowledging him that he ſent to teach you) <hi>your ſinne remayneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which it is more then manifeſt, That the ſpirit of Pryde, blinding a mans iudgment from penetrating the ſenſe of Scripture, and imboldning him like another Bayard to expound the ſame to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is moſt properly the ſpirit of hereſie. But now it cannot be denyed, that the Fayry which led away your Biſhop was the ſpirit of pryde, as appeareth by thoſe effects which it produced in him, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in telling him, that he was <hi>rich, and neded no body</hi> to aſſiſt him, making him appeare ſo prudent, circumſpect, and all ſufficient in his owne conceyt; as that he neded not the aduice of any, perſwading him to write bookes of thoſe things, which no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man had euer taught him, and to profeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an vniuerſall Doctour, ſent from God to teach the world; hauing neuer been any mans Scholler from whome he might receiue his doctrine; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpirit that moued him hereunto, could be no other then the ſpirit of hereſy. Whereby you ſee, that the vayne man, did not try his ſpirit by the rules of Scripture, as he ought to haue done, but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued his ſpirit before he tryed him; &amp; ſuffred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very eaſily to be deluded by him. And thus much of my ſecond Argument, taken out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt himſelf; and out of his owne words, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne concluſion. From whence, I alſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7997:13"/>drawe my third, and laſt argument, and briefly thus I propound it:</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of true Faith is neuer giuen but by meanes of a Preacher or Teacher,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.</note> which is all one. And therefore according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> no man can truely <hi>beleeue without a lawfull Preacher,</hi> becauſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is the meanes which God hath ordained to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert thoſe that ſhalbe ſaued. And ſo we read, that (to ſhew the neceſſity therof) S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerted by Chriſt, who appeared to him in his way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> was ſent for his further inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Ananias.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Riſe</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and go into the Citty, and it ſhalbe told thee what thou oughteſt to do.</hi> And the <hi>Centurion</hi> of the <hi>Italian</hi> Band, albeit he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that an Angell ſhould appeare vnto him:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10.1.3.5.</note> yet he was commaunded to ſend for ſuch a man in ſuch a houſe, in ſuch a Citty, which man ſhould tell him what he ought to do. So likewiſe the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of Queene <hi>Candaces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> could not be conuerted without a Preacher, becauſe Almighty God being a louer of order, would in no caſe diſpence or breake this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of his owne Decree. And therfore S. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> was ſent to inſtruct this potent <hi>Eunuch,</hi> although he were as it ſeemeth very wiſe and very vertuous, and wanted neither a Bible (which he had in his Coach with him) nor Gods holy Angell to aſſiſt him. Who when S. <hi>Philip</hi> had done his office <hi>rapuit eum</hi> (ſaith the text) carried him ſodainely out of ſight, thereby to confirme the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſo much the more, in that faith which he had receiued.</p>
               <p>But this new Ghoſpeller as himſelfe boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, neuer conferred with any mortall man, nor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7997:13"/>neuer read any Authour of this his new Religion, before he was fully reſolued to be a perfect Engliſh Proteſtant; from whence it may alſo be inferred, that he neuer came in the ayre, nor that any body els was myraculouſly tranſported thither to inſtruct him, leaſt any man ſhould imagine the contrary. And therfore it is moſt certayne, that he could neuer receiue the ſpirit of true fayth, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth only by a lawfull Preacher: and that he did not obſerue the rules ſet downe for the receiuing of it, <hi>in holy Scripture,</hi> which is againſt the true triall of ſpirits, that he pretendeth: and which, though he would make you belieue yet he neuer proueth, and his owne words, as I haue ſhewed by 3. moſt manifeſt, and moſt conuincing reaſons, do euidently diſproue him.</p>

               <p>VVHICH three Arguments haue the more force againſt him, in reſpect of three other circumſtances, very worthy your good conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For firſt, hauing been ſo long a Religions man as he reporteth, he muſt needs haue learned, that there is no vice whereby the Diuell taketh ſuch hold to draw a man headlong on, and to bring him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force to euerlaſting ruyne, as by perſwading him to neglect the counſell of others, and to confide in his owne wit and priuate vnderſtanding. The Diuell is fitly compared to a diſhoneſt louer, who, as long
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7997:14"/>as the maiden or matrone whom he ſoliciteth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to keep his counſell, ſo long he purſueth his wicked purpoſe. But if once he vnderſtand, that ſhe doth communicate the matter with her Father or Husband, he preſently knows his ſute is could; and fearing a worſe matter, he not only forbeareth to moleſt her, but alſo auoydeth her ſight, and flyeth her company. When a doubtfull thought of good or euill, ariſeth in our mynd, if we neglect to take aduice, and contemne ſpirituall counſell, it is an euident ſigne, that our Ghoſtly enemy either hath already, or that he will deceiue vs very ſhortly. For the ſuggeſtions of the Diuell haue force, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſo long vpon vs, as we couer, and hyde them within vs. On the other ſide, no ſooner are thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions, and imbroylements diſcouered where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Diuell laboreth to inſnare vs: but being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his owne workes, like a ſerpent brought to that light which he cannot indure, he flyeth out of his den wherin he lurked, and is forced to ſeeke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other habitation. For confirmation wherof, I haue hard it obſerued often tymes by very many, both Catholikes and Proteſtants, that more are brought to miſchrefe, &amp; compelled to murther themſelues in England, by the inſtigation of the Diuell then in all Chriſtendome beſides that is Catholike, put togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Becauſe ſay they in other Catholike Countreys, there be many alwayes ready and dayly expoſed in their Churches, vnto whome ſuch, as fynd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in great anguiſh and affliction of mynd, may open their harts vnder ſeale of confeſſion, with as much ſecrecy, and ſecurity as they can deſire. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7997:14"/>in England, there being none vnto whome men in ſuch caſes are accuſtomed to haue recourſe, their affliction boyleth more and more within them, vpon the fire which the Diuell increaſeth, vntill at laſt they be inforced (like the ſwyne of the <hi>Geraſens</hi>) <hi>to caſt themſelues headlong downe into the ſea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.32.</note> of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which obſeruation of theirs ſeemeth to be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded not only vpon experience, but alſo to ſtand with great reaſon. For God and Nature hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that not only for the wants of our bodyes, but alſo for our neceſſityes and vexations of mynd, we ſhould craue the help and aſſiſtance one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to the end that by this meanes, we might be the more obliged to keep reſpectiue company, aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mutuall loue togeather. For as a vehement burning feauer is no way to be cured but with ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a veyne, whereat the infected bloud hauing vent, may carry away with it the putrified matter that did moleſt the body: ſo, againſt any ſtrong temptation or affliction of the mynd, there is no remedy more ſecure, then to open the hart vnto a ſpirituall friend, whereby, our vnquiet Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions breaking forth, they leaue our mynd caſed of thoſe raging paſſions, that did before moleſt our ſoule. And therfore our Sauiour out of his infinite Wiſedome and goodnes towards vs, hath ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs the vttering of our griefes, and the manifeſtation of our conſcience vnto others, that he hath gruen his benediction, with the effects of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable grace vnto it; whereby he hath alſo made it a Sacrament,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.</note> inioyning all men that will haue <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> of their ſinnes at his hands, to the Religious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7997:15"/>vſe and practiſe of it. And further he gaue aduice to ſuch as would be perfect: That ſelling all they had and giuing it to the poore, and taking vp their Croſſe, they ſhould follow him, renouncing their owne wills, in perfect obedience to thoſe whom he ſhould ſend to direct them. Whereby, obyeing their Superiour, they obayed him; &amp; might be ſure by this meanes, that the Diuell himſelfe ſhould not deceiue them. Wherefore the Biſhop hauing been a Religious man, and hauing vnderſtood the neceſſity of this doctrine, and the conformity thereof to the light both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and hauing tyed himſelfe by vow to the practice of it; in reiecting and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, he hath offended moſt grieuouſly, not only againſt his <hi>Vow,</hi> but alſo againſt the rule of Faith: and which is worſt of all, againſt the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> and common ſenſe of humane Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>The ſecond circumſtance that did aggrauate his Fault is this; that he knew right well the buſines he had in hand to be full of danger, both temporall and eternall; and alſo to ſurpaſſe the deepeſt reach of the wit of man. And therefore he might alſo haue knowne that the holy Scripture could neuer be well expounded by any particuler Senſe, or priuate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. All which reſpects did oblige him ſo much the more to read other mens opinions, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with others. For all Hereſyes are grounded, though falſly, vpon the Scripture: and all Heretikes deceaſed are iuſtly damnd, for hauing confided ouer much in their owne priuate iudgment, the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions whereof they beheued vndoubtedly to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7997:15"/>the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, in their falſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuions which they framed to themſelues of Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his Fault is much more augmented, becauſe as himſelfe confeſſeth, he neuer knew what the Proteſtants held. For he ſaith as you haue heard, that he neuer ſpake with any of them: that he dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to read their bookes: and that he doubted moſt vehemently, that the Catholike Doctours did not deliuer faithfully the Proteſtants opinions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all theſe circumſtances, not to learne, not to conſult, not to read, not to conferre, not to aske one queſtion, in a buſines which he debated with himſelfe for the ſpace of ten years, ſo important as is the matter of Religion, ſo obſcure, ſo dangerous, and wherof he was ignorant by his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion: and therewith all to forſake his Countrey, and to make profeſſion of a Religion which he knew not, contrary to that which he had taught vnto more then two whole Kingdomes for ſo many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather; beſides too much Folly and madnes, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth a mynd no leſſe proud and arrogant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in his owne wit, then is fit for the ſpirit of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I proteſt before God that I did neuer reſpect any worldly end, <q>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no euill ſpirit could deceaue me. Which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he goeth about to proue in this manner. I did not ſeeke any eccleſiaſticall dignity, being then a Primate, and might eaſily haue gotten more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, both in <hi>Rome</hi> (but that I abhorred the manners of that Court) and alſo in <hi>Venice,</hi> where my<note n="*" place="margin">In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of the <hi>Scocchi.</hi>
                     </note> deſerts were great. Nor did I reſpect any tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall meanes, poſſeſſing ſufficient for a moderate mind, which I haue alwayes carryed, God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for it. But in this my change I haue for ſaken, both honour and goods, and therefore no worldly and, no vnbridled affection no temporall neceſſity, no ſoday ne euent or ſharpe misfortune, which are wont to carry men away, did compell me to leaue my countrey.</q> But what it was, without fraud or deceit, I will tell you ſincerely. Thus he in effect.</p>
               <p>In which diſcourſe, as in his former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo heere, I would haue you obſerue, that he taketh vp all vpon truſt, and giueth no other ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only his bare word, to content the Reader. For my part, I do verily thinke that he was once a Primate, but yet I muſt needs ſay, that boaſting &amp; craking of his owne worth in euery leaſe, ſaying much and prouing nothing, he reſembleth more then a little ſuch a counterfaire Prelate as <hi>Monſignor fate not</hi> is ſuppoſed to be. For who was euer in his conſcience to ſee the truth of what he proteſteth? Who knoweth what dignity he might haue had in the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> What his merits were in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:7997:17"/>what wealth, what moderate mind he had, and what he hath loſt by his comming thither? Which particulers before I go any further, I thinke good to touch a little, as I paſſe along.</p>
               <p>And firſt to omit that he knoweth not himſelfe, and that he muſt needs be ignorant of his owne conſcience, being ſo much blinded, and ſo ſtrongly deluded by the deceiuer himſelfe, as I haue proued, and therfore, that in no caſe he ſhould be truſted: letting this paſſe, I ſay, it is moſt ridiculous which he ſayth; that he eſtranged himſelfe from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he euer abhorred the manners of that court. For firſt there haue liued in his tyme as many worthy Popes, and Cardinalls in the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as haue flouriſhed in many aget before them. For there haue raigned Popes, <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. <hi>Clemens</hi> 8. <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

All which, although ſome of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are not very gratefull to our Kingdome, yet are moſt renowned for their vertues in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian countreys. And as for Cardinalls, there hath liued famous <hi>Horromaeus,</hi> who ſince his death was canonized for a Saint, <hi>Paliottus, Caraffa, Baronius, Tarugius,</hi> moſt exemplar for their paſtorall life, and for the rare ſanctity of their domeanour. To ſpeak nothing of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the mirrour of Chriſtendom at this day, <hi>Sfondratus, de Monte, Borromaus, Pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Roofacautius,</hi> and others now aliue.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7997:17"/>many to be named, men moſt famous to the better part of the world, for their learning piety, wiſdome and ſplendour in all kind of vertue. All which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table men, were ſo farre from the abhorring of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or taking any hurt thereby, that they increaſed the ſpiritual Tallents which they brought with them, and arriued to the fullnes of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by frequenting the ſame, and liuing in it. And to ſpeake of them all in generall at this day, their Courts are meruailouſly well gouerned, and cannot be touched with any crime of apparant ſcandall, which may eaſily be belequed by all that pleaſe to conſider their great occupations, which exclude idlenes, the mother of all corruption of manners in Princes houſes. For the Cardinalls in <hi>Rome</hi> are not only the protectours of Colledges, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiour Ordere, and whole Nations, which doth coſt them much lubour, but haue alſo the gouernement of the temporall eſtate, in the Popes poſſeſſion, and of the whole Church of God vnder his Holynes: and are therfore deuided into many Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations, to he are, and examine, and referre to the Pope, and afterward to determine of all kind of buſines. And befides this, to ſay nothing of their Viſitations, as well of one another, as alſo of the Ambaſſadours which come thither from all Catholike Countreys, according as Ciuility Charity, and the cuſtome of that place requireth. They cannot omit to frequent the Conſiſtoryes, and the ſolemnityes of the Popes chappel, places of deuotion, of Statio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of the prayer of 40 houres, of ſermons, of the meetings of learned men, and of diſputations; to al which they are dayly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7997:18"/>inuited. And as for women, who ioyned with idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are the 2. capitall heads of all ſcandall and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in Princes pallaces, their Courts are ſo free from them, that their own kinſwomen do not lodge in their houſes; nor do women at any tyme reſort to their pallaces, but vpon ſpeciall buſines, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with their husbands, or other neer kinſmen, which alſo is done very ſeldome. Their familyes for the moſt part, confeſſelland communicate once a moneth. There is no diſorder of gaming for much money, no exceſſe in drinking, no riot, no mortall quarrels, nor open contention to be noted in their houſes.

               <p>And therefore, in that the abſurd nicenes of this <hi>Dalmatian,</hi> abhorred the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it doth not argue any euill in the place, but diſcone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a corrupt ſtomache in him, who (like the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall child when he was at worſt) loathing the bread of his Fathers houſe, tooke ſuch delight in Swynes meate, that it ſeemeth he can receiue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nouriſhment.

For beſides that hath been ſayd before, in <hi>Rome</hi> the law is moſt ſeuere againſt Wantonnes, and Licentiouſnes in the Clergy, which is puniſhed not only with degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and perpetual infamy, but alſo with the <hi>ſtrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pado</hi> at leaſt. And in my tyme a Prieſt of good exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour quality, being taken in a vineyard-houſe with a naughty woman, his coach &amp; horſes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate, ſhe was whipt, and he himſelfe was ſent to the Gallies. But in <hi>Venice</hi> (the more is the pitty) there is no puniſhment at all for thoſe crymes, but that Prelates, and Religious men, if they ſhould be ſo affected, without publique rebuke, or any great note of infamy, might frequent diſhoneſt houſes at their pleaſure, which perchance made the Biſhop like the better of the ſeruice, or rather of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of that Citty.</p>
               <p>And now as touching his merits with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereof he ſpeaketh in the next place, I feare they are no better then may well be compared to the merits of <hi>Iudas</hi> with the Sinagogue: For as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And albeit among other his good offices, he wrote thoſe Bookes in their defence, wherof now he vaunteth: yet he went ſo farre, and diſcouered ſo much Hereſy in them, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> themſelues, could not chuſe but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of them. And therefore he could not expect at their hands any recompence for ſuch a labour. What riches he had, I know not, nor whether or no they were ſufficient for that moderate mind which God had giuen him.

               <p>As concerning that, which in this caſe he ſayth he hath left for Gods ſake: You muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that although he were a Primate, yet the rents of his Biſhopricke might be ſomewhat leſſe then the fruits of a good benefice are there with you. And I haue heard it very credibly reported, that they ſcarſly amount to the value of two hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And though they were more, yet I dare ſay, that hauing leaue to come for England, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought that he ſhould looſe much by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, eſpecially imagining himſelfe a much greater and worthyer man, then <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> was, whome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7997:19"/>the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> was inforced to pay ſweetly, and to reward ſo bountifully as the world knoweth for his comming thither. But the truth is (and ſo you will find it) that at his comming away, he was neither Primate, nor had any Biſhopricke at all: for long before he had reſigned the ſame to his Nephew, reſeruing a penſion to himſelfe, of three hundred crownes a yeare, or there about, which not ſufficing to maintayne his fat paunch, it is moſt probable that he came into England for the ſame cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other, that the prodigall child went to feed Swyne: that is to ſay, for meer want, as not hauing ſufficient to fill his belly</p>
               <p>Laſtly therefore, before I make an end with his ſecond reaſon, becauſe he ſayth, that he hath read Logicke amongſt his Fathers of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; do but marke a little I pray you, the concluſion of his argument, wherein you muſt needs ſee, that the ſumme of his accompt is a great deale more then the particulers of his reckoning. For hauing ſayd, that neither Ambition, nor Auarice did draw him from his countrey, he concludeth that no vnbridled affection, no temporall neceſſity, no ſtrange euent, nor grieuous miſchance did compell him to depart: which you ſee is a great deale more then theſe two particulers alone, of the abſence of Ambition and Auarice, can excuſe him from. But it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the old man ſhould haue forgot the Art of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whome Pride, and diſcontentment haue made to forget in great part euen reaſon it ſelfe.

               <p>AND with this he beginneth (pag. 7.) thoſe his proofes of ſpirit, which I call affirmatiue, and which (reducing them into three heads) I wil brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe vnto you, that you may ſee the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his booke, and afterward I ſhall examine them as I ſhall haue occaſion. In the firſt ranke he ſetteth downe certaine diſpoſitions (as I take it) which might prepare his mind to this change. In the ſecond, he layeth down the reaſons that moned him to alter his Religion. In the third he produceth thoſe conſiderations, that inforced him to leaue his Countrey, and ſo ſhewing how much he confided in the prouidence of God that conducted him he laboureth to defend himſelfe from Schiſme, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Pope, as the authour thereof, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his whole booke, inuiting the Pope to accept of the conditions he offereth, and to come to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him.</p>
               <p>Beginning therefore with thoſe thinges, that ſomewhat a far off might diſpoſe his mind to change Religion, he ſaith firſt, pag. 7. That from a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7997:20"/>boye he was much troubled with a vehement ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Roman doctrine was not true, which ſuſpition he euer reſiſted. Secondly, he ſayth pag. 8. and 9. That this ſuſpition was much increaſed in him, becauſe he ſaw, that neither ſtudents were permitted to read ſuch writers, as were contrary to the doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> being inforced to beleeue, that the opinions of thoſe writers were truly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them by their Maiſters: nor ſuch as had heard their deuinity, and were preferred to Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall dignity could be allowed to read any ſuch authours. Thirdly he ſayth, that from the firſt yeare of his Clergy, he had nouriſhed in himſelfe, an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> deſire of the vnion of al Chriſtian Churches, inquyring what might be the cauſe of their Schiſme, which did excruciate and torment his mynd, and doth ſtill conſume and waſt him (as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by looking vpon him) with ſuch grief and ſorrow as is wonderfull. Fourthly, telling you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, pag. 11. That leauing the Society of Ieſus where he had read Mathematickes, Rethoricke, Logicke, and Philoſophy, preached often, &amp; done them other domeſticall ſeruice, for the which they were very ſory to leaue him, he ſayth, Fiftly, page 11. and 12. That being made a Biſhop, and falling to read bookes of printted Sermons; <hi>Quadrageſimalls,</hi> and others, for the exerciſe of his Epiſcopall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in preaching, he found great abuſe of Scripture in them, apocriphall, and ridiculous examples, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of Auarice, and Ambition, not without ſuperſtition, wherewith the people were deluded. Sixtly he ſayth, pag. 13. That in reading the Fathers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7997:21"/>he obſerued that his maiſters had taught him many thinges againſt them, and that the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline of our tyme did differ very much from the auncient practiſe therof.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations I haue called diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſomewhat prepared his mynd to make mutation of Religion, becauſe (as he ſaith) they made him to ſee, as it were a farre off, that matters went not well, and becauſe all this while he did not fully conſent, but made ſome kind of reſiſtance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Wherein before we paſſe any further, not to confound you with too much matter togeather, let vs conſider, whether that which he hath brought be of any moment to perſwade his Reader that his new beleefe proceded from God.</p>
               <p>And to begin with his vehement ſuſpition, which was the firſt ſeed, from whence his vocation ſprung (wherein, and in the other three aſſertions which follow, I wilbe content to do him that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy, which he refuſed to ſhew vnto his Maiſters, and to ſuppoſe he cyteth the booke of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence aright, though none but himſelfe can looke into it) it appeareth euidently thereby, that this new ſeed of ſuſpition, was nothing els but the worſt kind of cockle, which our enemy and his, the Father of Hereſy, is wont to ſow vpon the good Corne of Chriſt. For ſuſpition is nothing els, but an opinion of euill without any iuſt or ſufficient ground, as the Rhetoritians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Thom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 60. <hi>art.</hi> 3.4.</note> Philoſophers, and Deuines define it. And therefore it alwayes importeth ſome fault, and ſome iniury done to the party who is thereby wronged, becauſe vniuſtly ſuſpected; whereof I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7997:21"/>maruell, how your learned Biſhop could be ignorant. Wherefore to ſuſpect, and concerue an ill opinion of ſo many as he did, in a matter of ſuch importance, without any reaſon or ſufficient cauſe, was a ſinne, and that a great one; eſpecially in him, who at that tyme thought himſelfe bound in conſcience, to belieue entirely the whole doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if to doubt of any article of Faith without inclyning to either ſide, be an act of Hereſy (as all Deuines do affirme) then much more to ſuſpect, which is to inclyne, and to giue ſome conſent to any motion contrary to the very ground of Faith, muſt needs be Hereſy. But you will ſay, the Biſhop made reſiſtance thereunto, and therefore he did not ſinne againſt his conſcience. To which I anſwere. If when the thought therof came firſt to his mynd, he did repell it, that then in that caſe it neuer grew to be any ſuſpition: but if once it came to be ſuſpition, as he affirmeth it was; then hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſo great euil vpon ſleight occaſion (or rather no occaſion at all) it cannot be denyed, but that he ſinned in admitting the ſame, though he might do well afterward in changing his mynd, and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe againſt it. And therefore this ſuſpition being ſo great a ſinne, it could not be inſpired into him from God Almighty. So as it can no way be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that this firſt motion ariſing in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops mynd againſt the Catholike Religion, was the bad ſeed ſowne by the Diuell, which ſprung vp out of his owne Malice, Pryde, Leuity, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; from whence neither a good tree, nor good
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7997:22"/>fruite can be expected. For as you know, <hi>Paruus error in principio, magnus in fine:</hi> and if the light it ſelfe, wherewith he began to worke, be darkenes, then the works themſelues, that proceded from it, muſt needs be the workes of extreme darkenes.</p>
               <p>Let vs now proceed to the increaſe of this his ſtrong and vehement ſuſpition (as he tearmeth it) occaſioned (as he ſaith) by the ſtrict prohibition of ſuch books as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the Roman doctrine. Which likewiſe we ſhall find, that as it begun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon ſo was it augmented vpon a very falſe and friuolous reaſon; and as it ſprung out of pryde and leuity, ſo was it fed and nouriſhed with pryde and curioſity. And therefore the new ſtrength or force which it receiued, could not proceed from the ſpirit of God. For ſuppoſing (as all Catholikes do, and as he then did) that ſuch kind of bookes are full fraught with the poyſon of Hereſy, which is the moſt damnable vice of all other; it ſtandeth with great reaſon, that they ſhould in no caſe, admit ſuch dangerous warres amongſt them: for ſuch bookes being once admitted, they eaſily paſſe from maiſters and learned men, to the hands, not only of Schollers, but alſo of other ſimple people; who not knowing what they are, but feeding of all the bread that comes from the Baker, and of all the diſhes that are ſet before them, inſteed of wholeſome meat ſhould fall vpon poyſon; for whoſe ſoules their negligent paſtors ſhould anſwere to God at the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For I pray you, if ſome vnquiet and ambitious ſpirit in other Countreys, ſhould make clayme to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and call in queſtion the Kings
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7997:22"/>title, though neuer ſo cleere with vs; do you thinke that the Pleas, and Proceſſe of ſuch a man, ſhould be remitted to the reading of euery yong ſtudent, or Counſellour at Law in the Ins of Court? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if this Claymer, or Pretender had got ſome Lawyers to be of his ſide, and had made a party which followed him, and ſought to ſet footing in England? Much more is it neceſſary for thoſe that haue the gouerment of ſoules to be iealous of their ſafty, &amp; to be vigilant for the preſeruation of peace amongſt them. But you will ſay vnto me, why then are Catholike Latin writers permitted to be read by our miniſters and others here in <hi>England?</hi> to which I anſwere; that the caſe is farre different.</p>
               <p>For firſt <hi>England</hi> was neuer yet fully Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, the Catholike number remayning ſtill very great: and therefore the ſtate of England in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, might do well to follow the example of the primitiue Church, wherein, after that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion was publiquely profeſſed, becauſe a great part of the Gentills were not then conuerted, not only their bookes and writings were tolerated, but their religion it ſelfe, although it were moſt groſſe Idolatry, was permitted. Beſides in England, the Catholikes being many, wiſe, and learned, do not ceaſe, by alledging moſt pregnant proofes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſons, and authenticall teſtimonyes, to mayntaine the truth of their cauſe, and to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to imbrace their doctrine.</p>
               <p>In which regard it ſtandeth the Proteſtants vpon, and eſpecially the Miniſters, to read their bookes, thereby to defend themſelues and others, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7997:23"/>well as they can from the force of the Catholike ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought againſt them. And for the ſame cauſe in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in all other Countreyes where many religions are allowed; the Catholike Students, and other ſecular men are vſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually permitted to read all kind of bookes, the better therby to refute their errours. Which this good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop thought good to conceale for his owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But in thoſe other Catholike Countreys, which were neuer yet infected with Hereſy; and where there is no occaſion to impugne it: there it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that the Paſtours be very vigilant to keep it out. For Hereſy being once gotten in, it crepeth like a canker, and at laſt breaketh out like a raging fire; and burneth ſo dreadfully, that whole Cittyes, and Kingdomes, and Nations haue been conſumed with it in a very ſhort ſpace, as may appeare in <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> &amp; other Countreys. And therfore in all ages, not only the Fathers, Doctours and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, but alſo Men, Women, and Children of the Catholike Church, haue euer concurred with all ſpeed, and with might and mayne, to quench and ex inguiſh the leaſt ſparke therof. By which meanes it is wonderfull to conſider, in how ſhort a tyme the bookes and writings of all the ancient Heretikes in former ages haue been conſumed, and aboliſhed by the zeale of Catholikes. In ſo much, as of ſo many millions of their Volumes, there is not at this day one left remayning.</p>
               <p>But this good man, the Biſhop, is of another mynd, who if it were poſſible, would dig thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours out of hell againe, to ſee whether they were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7997:23"/>truely cited by choſe that wrote againſt them. And for the preſent he would permit, without any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuch mens workes to be familiarly read, whom the Apoſtle forbiddeth to be ſaluted. Our mother <hi>Eue,</hi> out of a vayne curioſity, conferring with the ſerpent, whome ſhe might thinke to be an Angell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2.</note> fell into Hereſy: but this man out of a curioſity more then monſtrous,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 10.3.5</note> would perſwade <hi>the ſheep of Chriſt to heare the voyce of a ſtranger;</hi> and to conferre with that ſerpent whome they know and confeſſe to be the Diuell. Wherfore this ſpirit of his, being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſpirit of the Church, to the ſpirit of the Apoſtle, to the ſpirit of Chriſt himſelfe, and in fine contrary to the light of reaſon in the Gouernement both of Church and Common Wealth; you may eaſily indge from whence it commeth, and to what end it tendeth. Whereby you will alſo coniecture what vnion, and coniunction may be of the Eaſt and of the Weſt, of the North and South; with the deſire whereof this good Biſhop is ſo much tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For it can be nothing els, but a horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them all, and the vtter ouerthrow of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme, that you may the better perceiue, his naturall and <hi>inborne</hi> deſire of vnity, wherewith his poore hart is ſo much tormented, he wil make it knowne himſelfe you vnto by the effects thereof. For preſently after he tells you, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided himſelf from the vnion of that Society wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was vowed, and ſeparated himſelfe from the body of that order whereof he was a member, like a branch from his vyne; from the which being once
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7997:24"/>cut of, it was likely he could be good for nothing but to be caſt into the fire. The great comendations he giueth of his owne learned &amp; laborious life, whiles he was in Religion, I can hardly belieue. For wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this booke as he doth to no other end, but only to blaze his owne prayſes, you need not doubt, but that euery where he ſpeaketh the moſt of himſelfe, or more then the moſt. And ſuppoſing it to be true, it amounteth (God he knoweth) but to a very ſmall matter; eſpecially being done for humane prayſe, wherewith he payeth himſelfe inſteed of others that ſhould reward him for it. It may be, that in reſpect of his proud and vnquiet ſpirit, his Superiours were inforced to proue him in many things, to ſee what good they might make of him. But in the end, it ſhould ſeeme by his going forth (which was like to be vpon ſome diſcontentment) that they found him fit for nothing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Ieſus</hi> may fittly be compared to the ſea, that caſteth forth the dead bodyes, or to a veſſell of new wine, which purgeth all the traſh and corrupt matter that is mingled with it, and therefore they eaſily permit ſuch as be not fit for them, to depart from them, leaſt by ſtaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, being ſtopt vp cloſe like corruption togeather with the pure wine, they ſhould breake the veſſell it ſelfe wherein they are incloſed. And albeit for this cauſe, it be more eaſy for ſuch as are ill diſpoſed to quit themſelues of the <hi>Society,</hi> then for any other <hi>Religious</hi> men to be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other <hi>Orders:</hi> yet the dreadfull iudgments of God haue beene ſo many, and ſo wonderfull vpon thoſe, that haue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7997:24"/>wrought themſelues out of their <hi>Company,</hi> that an honeſt and a pious mind, ſhould be more terrified therewith, then with the priſons and fetters of other <hi>Orders.</hi> Whereby alſo God himſelfe hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world, that the diſpenſation which is ſomtime giuen to thoſe that are diſmiſſed the <hi>Society</hi> doth acquit them of their vowes, according to the cauſe of their departure; which if it be good and ſufficient, it taketh away the whole obligation, but if it be not (as I feare me this mans was not) they are not diſcharged before God and their conſcience, but they remayne ſtill in the laps, and in the ſtate of Apoſtaſy from their Religion.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, he wanted not ſufficient cauſe to depart: for he that deſireth to be made a Biſhop, deſireth a good worke, and this man went forth to be made a Biſhop. To which I anſwere, that the worke of a Biſhop is good, but not the deſire to be made a Biſhop.<note place="margin">Chry. hom. <hi>3.</hi> in oper. imperf ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>3.</hi> in Matt.</note> 
                  <hi>To deſire Primacy in the Church</hi> (according to S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>) <hi>is neither iuſt, nor profitable.</hi> And <hi>Primacy</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>deſireth thoſe that deſire it not, and abhorreth thoſe that deſire it.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe the worke of a Biſhop, is a calling of ſuch perfection, and ſuch dignity, &amp; alſo danger ioyned with it, that whoſoeuer he be, that thinketh himſelfe ſo ſufficient for it, and ſo worthy of it, as to ſue and ſeek after it, ſheweth to haue ſo much pride and ſelfe-conceit; as is ſufficient to make him vnworthy. Beſides that, it is a thing expreſly &amp; directly againſt the inſtitute of the Society, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this man liued, to ſeeke and hunt for preferment. <hi>Euery man in the vocation, whereunto he is called, let him

But this man, though forſaking Gods plough, wherunto his hand was conſecrated, &amp; though breaking his firſt vowes, for the which according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſhould feare to be damned, doth thereby thinke to haue made himſelfe fit to be made a gouernour in Gods kingdome, which is the Church of Chriſt; truly ſuſpecting, as he did, the Catholike doctrine to be falſe and fraudulent, he might better haue ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that being in this caſe, he was no fit man to be made a Biſhop, whoſe office it is, to maintayne and defend it. And I meruaile knowing himſelfe to be a dog,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> that began to take part with the wolues more then with the ſheep, not thinking it fit that they ſhould truſt their ſhepheards, but rather deſiring that they might heare what the wolues could ſay for themſelues, and hand to hand debate their reaſons with them: I maruaile I ſay, with what good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuch a dog could thinke himſelfe fit to be made a ſheepheard.</p>
               <p>To that which he ſayeth of printed Sermons, and his Maiſters dictates: I anſwere firſt, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were true, yet becauſe they be no rules of faith, and that the Catholikes are not bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in all thinges, either the one, or the other, as himſelfe knoweth well inough; therfore ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7997:25"/>as theſe, ſhould not haue moued him to depart from the vnity of the Church of God. Secondly I ſay, that if it were not altogeather falſe, it ſhould haue beene proued by him one way or other; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would had beene alleadged out of thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monaries, whome he ſo much reuyleth; and ſome one point or other would haue beene vrged for an inſtance, wherein his Maiſters did contradict the Fathers. Vnles he thought his Readers to be ſo many Pots without couers, that ſhould receiue any thing by infuſion, which he pleaſeth to powre, or let fall into them. Or vnleſſe you will excuſe him by ſaying, that as when he was conuerted to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he diſdayned to heare reaſon: ſo now inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to conuert others, he ſcorneth as much to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foard any reaſon for that he ſayth. Wherin he doth wiſely in one reſpect; for bringing no proofe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiduler, he ſaw, that albeit no man could in reaſon beleeue him, yet it ſhould be hard for any man to diſproue him. But notwithſtanding all his policy, to put ſomething more in the ballance of your iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides his yea, and my no, for the deciding of this matter betwixt vs, I will giue you the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Syr Edwyn Sands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Syr Edwin Sands rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7997:26"/>Schoole-deuines whoſe bookes are brought from thence, and are commonly ſould and much read in England. For it is very probable, that neuer in any age ſince Chriſtian Religion began to flouriſh in the world, there haue beene ſo many (I ſay ſo many) the like excellent Preachers, and profound Deuines in the Catholike Church, as we haue ſeen and heard in this age of ours.</p>
               <p>And thus much may ſuffice to haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the firſt kind of thoſe his proofes, which I called Affirmatiue, alleadged by him as vndoubted ſignes to ſhew that God was the author of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither.

And laſtly ſet him vp to be ſeen aloft, as it were vpon the pinacle of the Temple, where he knew, that in reſpect of his gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes and Pride, he was not able to ſtand, to the end that his owne victory might be the more glorious, and the Biſhops fall more famous.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION V.</hi> The Bishops Motiues to change his Religion are diſcuſſed: and the arguments of the ten books he promiſed are all reduced to one queſtion alone, of the Popes Supremacy.</head>
               <p>HITHERTO you haue heard of thoſe things that did ſomewhat prepare him to change Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and hitherto (as he ſayth) he reſiſted in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more or leſſe, theſe motions or ſuggeſtions that were contrary to his former faith. It followeth now to conſider, what moued him directly to this ſtrange mutation, which muſt needs be very wel worth the conſideration: For you may eaſily imagine, that being a man of his quality, learning, &amp; experience, he will ſay what may be ſayd, and lay downe ſuch prudent motiues, ſound reaſons, and well grounded proofes, if any ſuch may be found, as the truth of them ſhalbe ſo apparant and conuincing, that no indifferent, or well diſpoſed mynd ſhalbe able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them.</p>
               <p>He beginneth therfore and ſayth; that of a Biſhop, being made an Archbiſhop, two accidents fell out, that compelled him to ſtudy theſe matters more earneſtly, and more eagerly then before he did, and made him to ouerthrow, or to ouerturne, or turne ouer (as you pleaſe to expound him) more then once or twice the Fathers, the Canons, the Councells, and ancient Records of the Catholike Church.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7997:27"/>
               <p>The firſt occaſion was, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; his Suffragan Biſhops that were vnder him began to perturbe his Metropolitan rights. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that a little after the <hi>Interdict</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> there came bookes from <hi>Rome,</hi> taxing the Biſhops of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State who did not obey, to be but ſheepiſh, rude, and ignorant men, without courage or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; in which ſecond paſſage, he diſcouereth not only his pride and contentious ſpirit in ſeeking to ſuppreſe his owne Suffragans, and in reſiſting the publique authority of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Interdict, and in maintayning the ſheep againſt the ſheepheard, which is far againſt the vnity which he pretendeth: but alſo he doth manifeſt ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, malice, and enuy againſt the Pope, becauſe he oppoſed himſelfe to his vniuſt pretences, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Suffragans againſt him, as was no leſſe then ſufficient to make a man in his ſtate, and of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion become a formall Heretike. This therefore I take to be the laſt diſpoſition that made him a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the ſpirit of Hereſy: and whereby his enemy intred into him, as he entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi> and tooke full poſſeſſion of him. To the which I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induced, becauſe a man may eaſily ſee, that his ouerthrow in his Suite againſt his Suffragans ſticks deeply in his mynd, &amp; moueth him to ſeek reuenge, by the ouerthrow of that authority which ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. For afterward, page 22. he maketh it one of the principall cauſes of his departure, and complaineth with no leſſe vntruth, then malicious ſpirit, and extreme bitternes of hart; that Biſhops now a dayes vnder the Pope, haue but the name of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7997:27"/>Biſhops: that al their Iuriſdiction is taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <q>that they are become vile, contemptible and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: ſubiect not only to the Pope, but alſo to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, Congregations, Legates, Inquiſitors, and innumerable Orders of Religious men, who now haue greater facultyes then Biſhops, and drowne their authority. Where alſo he ſayth, that the Pope is now a temporall Monarch, and that the Church is become a vineyard, to make him drunke,</q> and a flocke to feed him with her owne bloud. All which conſidered, I do thinke verily, that they who intend to write againſt him, and to accuſe and calumniate (as he ſayth) his departure from them, will hardly be able to produce more pregnant and vehement ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to ſhew that he was expulſed and driuen forth by the Diuell; then he himſelfe hath derected in his owne diſcourſe, which he maketh to proue that he was ſent away by God Almighty.</p>
               <p>For beſides his leuity and inconſtancy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe, ſuſpecting the Catholike Church to be erroneous his diſobedience and Apoſtaſy in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his Order, his a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bition in ſeeking one prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after another, being moſt vnworthy of any, &amp; his vniuſt contention with thoſe that were vnder him, he paynteth out his owne malice and euny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, togeather with the occaſions therof in ſuch manner, as if he deſired the whole world ſhould take notice of it. Whereunto if we adde his extreme pride which he diſcouereth in the manner of his conuerſion, diſdayning to read any booke, or to ſpeake with any man about it, and in all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his former natration: &amp; alſo in that which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7997:28"/>followeth where he ſayth, that he hath no Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our aboue him, making himſelfe equall with the Pope in ſpirituall matters, and in authority to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and amend all other Biſhops. What can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that his aduerſaries will bring againſt him, which himſelf vnder the pretence of his own prayſe hath not heere confeſſed? <hi>Tatianus</hi> the authour of the <hi>Encratite</hi> Hereſy (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> reporteth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blowne great with the ſwelling opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of much learning,<note place="margin">Niceph. l. <hi>4.</hi> hiſt. c. <hi>4.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to read the Fathers, and other records of the Catholike Church, with thoſe ſpectacles of Pryde, Ambition, Malice, and the reſt, whereof I haue ſpoken before, let vs ſee what he findeth in them. For now he ſaith, that his eyes were opened, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7997:28"/>that he ſaw eaſily, plainely, and perfectly that the Churches, <q>whome <hi>Rome</hi> had made her enemyes, (which are very many, ſaith he) did differ little or nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pure doctrine of the ancient Church. That in <hi>Rome</hi> there are coyned euery day innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable articles of Faith, without any foundation, with extreme violence. That <hi>Rome</hi> hath puld out the eyes of the Church of Chriſt, by ſuppreſſing the ſacred Councells. That the Catholike Church, is now confined to be made the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> That in it, nay in the Pope alone, the whole ſpirit of Chriſt promiſed to the Catholike Church, is belieued to reſide. That whatſoeuer hath been ſpoken heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in honour of the vniuerſal Church, is now moſt wrongfully inforced vpon the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> alone, whereof it followeth, that the ſoules of men being thereby miſerably deceiued, and blinded, they fall togeather with their blind guydes into the pit of perdition. Thus he, &amp; theſe are the principall cauſes which he ſetteth downe for the chang of his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But what proofe, what euidence, what inſtance,</q> what reaſon or probability doth he alledge to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his reader of the truth of theſe things, or any of them? truely none at all, but only this; that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſayth it. A man altogeather a ſtranger to you, no way recommended, either for wiſedome, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or learning: but rather if not iuſtly to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of worſe, yet at the leaſt, to be iuſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of that extreme Malice, Pryde, and Vanity of hart, which himſelfe, diſcouereth.</p>
               <p>If any man be made of ſuch rotten earth, as to ſuffer this <hi>Ignoramus</hi> to ſet in him ſuch leekes as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7997:29"/>theſe, without any other ſtick, but with his finger: or to ſhew himſelfe ſuch an vncouered pot (as I ſaid before) as to receiue what liquor ſoeuer this ſtrang Biſhop ſhould pleaſe to infuſe into him; ſuch a one is worthy to be guld indeed by this <hi>Dalmatian.</hi> But he that is wiſe, ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider at leaſt with what falſe eyes he found theſe things, if it be true, that he hath read any part of the Fathers, the Canons, and the Councells, as himſelfe reporteth. For he that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth this, will no more belieue him (though he ſhould ſpeake as he thinketh, which I thinke he doth not) then he will belieue the Father of lyes that doth delude him. If the queſtion had been, whether or no he would haue ſayd as much as here he doth, he had indeed conuinced his reader, and confounded all thoſe that ſhould haue writ againſt him. But the queſtion being, not what he could ſay, but what he could proue; and whether it be true that he ſayth; and intending as he doth to arme his reader, againſt the accuſations that are like to come againſt him, to make it manifeſt that his ſpirit is from God; and in fine to edify all the world with his narration; you muſt needes graunt that he ſheweth extreme weaknes in making no better defence no leſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty of meanes and matter in buylding without a foundation, &amp; as much want of proofe to perſuade, in giuing you nothing but wordes inſteed of other ſubſtance. But you will reply; whatſoeuer he ſayth here, he promiſeth to proue, and purſue hereafter, in his Booke of Eccleſiaſticall Common Wealth I pray you, were it fit, that when a ſouldier cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the feild to fight, he ſhould come without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7997:29"/>and ſhould thinke either to ouercome his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary, or to ſatisfy the beholders of his proweſſe, by ſaying, that he hath an excellent ſword a making? Were it not abſurd, that a Scholler comming to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of any Probleme, ſhould thinke to ſatisfy the arguments of his aduerſary, or to perſwade his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, that the truth were of his ſide, by affirming that he would, or that he had compoſed a great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of that matter? This booke being made by the Biſhop to proue his ſpirit, to diſproue his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and to approue his change of Religion, to all thoſe that ſhould here thereof; now was the tyme to vſe his Weapons, to ſhew his Wiſedome, and to bring forth his euidence. And therefore if he ſayle of his proofes, it is an euident ſigne, that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather deſtitute and vnprouided of them.</p>
               <p>Neither is it true which he ſayth: That when his worke cometh forth, whatſoeuer he hath heere affirmed ſhalbe there proued. For how will he proue, that <hi>Rome</hi> hath coyned, not a 100. or a 1000. new articles of Fayth in one day, but as he ſayth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, and that euery day? How will he proue that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppreſſeth the Councells? Doth it not make them a rule of Fayth? hath it not alwayes preſerued them? doth it not mayntayne, and defend them from the calumniations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions which the Heretikes of theſe dayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt them? How will he proue, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the whole ſpirit of Chriſt to remayne in the Pope alone? and that all which hath been ſayd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, in the honour of the vniuerſall Church, muſt be applyed to the Court and Pallace of the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7997:30"/>Do we belieue that to be Catholike, one, holy, viſible, to haue conuerted Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which are ſome of the ſupernaturall prayſes, and excellencyes of the Catholike Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe ſhyneth like the ſunne in the Firmament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other Congregations or aſſemblyes? Do we belieue I ſay, as an article of our Fayth, that theſe things agree to the Pope and his Pallace alone? That the Pope or his Court is extended ouer al the world? That the Vnity, Holynes, Viſibility, and Miracles of the Church, and of the Paſtors and Saints thereof, are only to be found in the Pope and his Pallace? and that all other Catholike Nations, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, are excluded from the participation of theſe graces? can this be proued thinke you? And can it ſtand with the grauity, and reuerent authority of a Biſhop to affirme theſe things, with promiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them, making them alſo the ground of his conuerſion? Could any ignorant ſhameleſſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe learning were nothing els but lying: Could any <hi>Zani,</hi> or Counterfait that had been hyred to rayle againſt the Pope, haue ſpoken more fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more intemperatly, or more abſurdly?</p>
               <p>The innumerable new articles whereof he ſpeaketh, and the whole doctrine of ſo many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, impugned by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he vndertaketh to defend, can ſurely contayne no leſſe then all the points in Controuerſy betwene you, and vs; which are ſo farre from being decided in his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Wealth, that for the greater part of them, they cannot be ſo much as mentioned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For as it appeareth by his owne deſcription ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7997:30"/>the 4. firſt bookes proue only in effect, that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and their Churches by the Law of God are equall. And that neither S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor the Pope, nor the Roman Clergy, ſhould haue any Primacy, or Papacy, or Prehemynence aboue the reſt. In his 5. and 6. Booke, he taketh away all kind of iuriſdiction from the whole Church, not only in temporall, but alſo in Eccleſiaſticall matters. In his 7. booke he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth of the rule of Fayth. In the reſt that follow he ſpeaketh of nothing els, but only of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralityes, and immunityes of the Church. In the 8. he conſidereth the external gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church, by Lawes and Canons, which if he affirme to be lawfull, it is directly contrary to his 5. and 6. booke, wherein he reiecteth all kind of Iuriſdiction from the Church of Chriſt. So that this great booke wherof he braggeth ſo much, contayneth in effect but one Controuerſy alone. And he that ſhould proue the Popes Primacy and Supreme Iuriſdiction ouer the Church of God, ſhould ouerthrow the ſubſtance of this whole Volume. For thereof it would follow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; that the gouernement of Chriſts church vpon earth, is Monarchicall, againſt his firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke; that the gouernours of the Church are not equall in authority by the Law of God, againſt his third booke. That the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath preheminence ouer other Churches, againſt his fourth booke. That the Church of God hath Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, both Eccleſiaſticall directly, and temporall indirectly, the latter being neceſſary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynance of the former, againſt his 5. and 6. booke. That the decree of the Pope as Head of the Church
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7997:31"/>in a generall Councell is a ſufficient rule of Fayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his 7. booke. The reſolution alſo of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contayned in his 3. other bookes, is of no great importance, and may eaſily be deduced from the former concluſion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if he thinke to diſcharge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of all other poynts in Controueſy, by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the titles of theſe bookes alone, he ſhall behaue himſelfe like a Banquerupt, who inſteed of the whole debt, ſhould ſcarce make payment of one in the hundred.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> Concerning the Popes Supremacy: The ſtate of the queſtion is propoſed, and S. Peters Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is proued by Scripture.</head>
               <p>BVT now, as oftentymes it falleth out, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fayre ſhewes of Banquerupt Merchants, vnder their goodly inſcriptions of many rich com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes, and diſſembling text letters, vpon pots, packs, and boxes, there is nothing to be found, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps ſome poore refuſed brockage that is not ſalable: ſo to make it manifeſt that vnder theſe glorious titles of the ten Bookes which the Biſhop promiſeth, there is nothing contayned, but falſe wares, and idle tryfles, lapt vp in ſo many bundles of waſt paper. And to giue you withall, ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this one point of Controuerſy, of the Popes Supremacy, the occaſion being ſo fit, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not great, &amp; the way ſo well beaten by others;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7997:31"/>I will briefly ſet you downe, ſome of thoſe euident proofes wherewith the Catholikes are wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Popes Supremacy in ſpiritual matters. Whereby alſo it will appeare, how well the Biſhop hath ſpent his 10. yeares in reading of the Fathers, &amp; whether he haue more attended to his ſtudy, or to his belly.</p>
               <p>For the greater breuity, and more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in handling this ample, and copious matter; I will reduce all that I haue to ſay into one argument alone, which I frame in this manner. <hi>S. Peter</hi> the Apoſtle had Supremacy ouer the whole Church of Chriſt: but the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is only the true Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of <hi>S. Peter:</hi> therefore the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the place of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> hath alſo Supremacy ouer the whole Church of Chriſt. Out of which argument you may obſerue, that the ſtate of this Controuerſy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the proofe of two points. The firſt of <hi>S. Peters</hi> Supremacy, and the ſecond of the Popes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to <hi>S. Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For probation of the firſt point, out of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twenty places of Scripture alleadged by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> togeather with the expoſition of the holy Fathers thereupon, acknowledging therein the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or Principality of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of God; I will produce but two places alone. The firſt out of the ſixten of S. <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.17.</note> where the ſame was promiſed in theſe words. <hi>And Ieſus anſwering, ſayd vnto him: Bleſſed art thou</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bariona, <hi>becauſe fleſh and bioud hath not reuealed it vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen. And I ſay to thee, that thou art</hi> Peter <hi>(that is to ſay a Rock)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7997:32"/>and vpon this rocke will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not preuatle againſt it. And I will giue to thee the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen. And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou ſhalt bind on earth, it ſhall be bound alſo in the heauens. And whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe on earth, it ſhall be looſed alſo in the Heauens.</hi> Concerning which words, there are three thinges which I find to be queſtionable. The firſt, what our Sauiour promiſed vnder thoſe tearmes of a Rocke, or Foundation, of the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, and of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and looſing in earth and heauen. Which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the foundation is the rule and ſtrength of the whole buylding, and that the keyes commaund the whole Citty, opening and ſhutting the gates ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that the ſentence of a Supreme iudge, doth bind and looſe vpon earth; It ſeemeth to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that nothing els can be meant thereby, but only the rule, the commaund, and the gouernement of the Church, as it is compared to a building, or to a Citty, and as it is called the kingdome of God in Scripture. In which ſenſe, our Sauiour himſelfe, who of himſelfe is the ſupreme King, Head, and gouernour of the whole Church, is many tymes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Rocke therein. And he is alſo ſayd to <hi>beare the key of Dauid,</hi> and <hi>to haue the key of Hell.</hi> And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe affirmeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Da.</hi> 2.34. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 28 <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22.22. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.18.3.7. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.30.</note> 
                  <hi>the yoake which he impoſeth to be ſweet,</hi> and <hi>the burthen,</hi> which he byndeth vpon vs, <hi>to eaſy.</hi> And in the ſame ſenſe all the ancient Fathers haue euer vnderſtood this text of Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference or variation betweene them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which may be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable herein, is the perſon to whome theſe thinges
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7997:32"/>were promiſed, which being deſcribed to be S. <hi>Peter,</hi> with ſo many circumſtances of his <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,</hi> and the <hi>Name of his Father,</hi> of the <hi>prayſe</hi> of his former ſpeach, and <hi>Chriſts anſwere</hi> thereunto, and ſo many <hi>particles</hi> applyable only to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> as Ieſus anſwering, ſayd to <hi>Him,</hi> bleſſed art <hi>Thou,</hi> fleſh and bloud hath not reuealed to <hi>Thee,</hi> and I ſay to <hi>Thee; Thou</hi> art Peter, and vpon <hi>this Rocke</hi> (which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the originall is this in Engliſh: Thou art Peter, and vpon this Peter, or thou art Rocke, and vpon this Rocke I will build my Church). And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, vnto <hi>Thee</hi> will I giue the keyes &amp;c. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt bind &amp;c. whatſoeuer <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt looſe &amp;c. I ſay, if all theſe things conſidered, &amp; the perſon of S. <hi>Peter</hi> being thus particulerly deſcribed, doubt may be made vnto whom the Gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, then we may well ſay, that nothing is plaine, but that all thinges are moſt ambiguous in holy Scripture. Wherefore in this alſo, the Fathers do all agree, and all of them do gather out of this place, that the gouernement of Gods Church was giuen to <hi>S. Peter.</hi> Only S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who maketh no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to whome the keyes, and the authority of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and looſing, was giuen in this place, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſometymes the word <hi>Rocke,</hi> to be meant of Chriſt, whome S. <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed: Becauſe (ſaith he) our Sauiour ſayd not, <hi>tu es Petra,</hi> but <hi>tu es Petrus,</hi> wherein he was deceiued (as all men acknowledg) not vnderſtanding the Syriack tongue, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no more difference betweene the Maſculine and Feminine, then doth our Engliſh.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Retract. cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> And S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> himſelfe alſo hauing oftentymes expounded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7997:33"/>the word Rocke to be meant of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> leaueth both theſe expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the choyce of the Reader, without condemning either of them. The reſt of the Fathers out of this place, do all affirme the Church to be built both vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon the Faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> or vpon <hi>Peter</hi> in reſpect of his faith, which is al one. For which faith our Sauiour promiſed to reward him, by building his Church vpon him, and by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch ſolidity and ſtability thereunto, that the gates of Hell ſhould not prenayle againſt it. Laſtly, becauſe the Fathers do oftentymes affirme, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> receiued this power and authority, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Church, &amp; for the benefit of the Church, the laſt thing queſtionable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning theſe words is this. Whether he receiued the ſame as a Procter, or ſubſtitute alone, or as the head and chief of all the Apoſtles. For in both of theſe reſpects, one man may repreſent the perſons of many, as in it ſelfe it is manifeſt. But it ſeemeth alſo, that this is a queſtion of that, wherof no queſtion can be made. For al the Apoſtles being preſent, there was no neceſſity nor apparence, neither why, nor how they ſhould make S. <hi>Peter</hi> their atturney. And our Sauiour naming S. <hi>Peter</hi> in particuler, <hi>Symon Bariona,</hi> commending him in particuler, <hi>Bleſſed art thou,</hi> and confirming vnto him the name of Rocke in particuler; it muſt needs be vnderſtood that to him in particuler theſe promiſes were made of the regiment of Gods Church, and of founding the ſame vpon him, in ſuch manner, as that the gates of Hell ſhould not preuayle againſt it. And in this alſo, the Fathers do generally agree, as you will perceiue, by thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7997:33"/>which ſhall be produced thereby.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place of Scripture, which I will alleadge for the proofe of S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is in the ſecond of S. <hi>Iohn:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 21.15.</note> for what was promiſed in the 16. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> was there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. For calling him by the name of <hi>Symon,</hi> &amp; by the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> and by the name of <hi>Symon the ſonne of Iona,</hi> to ſignify that he applyed his ſpeach to himſelfe alone, and asking him firſt, whether he <hi>loued our Sauiour more then the reſt,</hi> and twice more, <hi>whether he loued him,</hi> whereby our Sauiour would ſignify, that he commended to his loue, the thing that was moſt deare vnto him; he commaunded him twiſe <hi>to feed his lambs,</hi> and the third tyme <hi>to feed his ſheep,</hi> whereby he made him the <hi>Paſtour</hi> of his flocke. And for a concluſion, to keep him in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he gaue him warning, that as he was to follow him in his place, ſo alſo he ſhould imitate him in his death; ſignifying what death he ſhould dye. That is to ſay, the death of the Croſſe. In the expoſition of which place, there is no diuerſity of opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Fathers, neither do they make any doubt or queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that our Sauiours ſpeach in this place was directed only to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> that by the word <hi>Sheep,</hi> the whole flocke of Chriſt was recommended vnto him, for the reſt of the Apoſtles themſelues were not excepted. And that by the word <hi>Feed,</hi> he was commaunded not only to teach, but alſo to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church of Chriſt, ſo far forth, as ſhould be neceſſary for the conduction of the members thereof, vnto their ſupernaturall end, which is life euerlaſting. And therefore, albeit all the Apoſtles,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7997:34"/>in reſpect of their Apoſtolike power, which was extraordinary, and dyed with them, had equall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ouer the reſt of the Church; yet were they not equall amongſt themſelues, but S. <hi>Peter</hi> in reſpect of his ſupreme Epiſcopall, and ordinary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was the chief and head of them all; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as they were Biſhops, or capable of Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prickes, wherein others might ſucceed them, they were all ſubiect to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And for this cauſe albeit the Church is ſayd to be built vpon the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in generall, and that they are alſo called the Paſtours therof; yet you ſhall neuer find, that any of them in particuler, as for example <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> or <hi>S. Iames,</hi> is tearmed the foundation, or the Paſtour of the Church, without any other limitation, but that theſe titles, and the like are giuen by the Fathers to S. <hi>Peter</hi> alone, in reſpect of the excellency of his dignity, and plenarity of ordinary power ouer the Church of Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Out of that which hath beene ſo copiouſly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7997:37"/>alleadged, if you pleaſe to reflect a little thereupon, you may gather the reaſon and ground of this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, of one Supreme herd in the Church of God Which alſo becauſe it doth more confirme the truth of that which hath beene ſayd, I will open a little, &amp; briefly declare vnto you. Firſt then; there is no queſtion to be made, but that our Sauiour Chriſt, whoſe workes are perfect, did therfore ordayne his Spouſe, the Church, to be gouerned by one alone, in his owne place vpon earth, becauſe this is the moſt excellent, and moſt perfect kind of Gouernement, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth at large, out of all the ancient Fathers, and Philoſophers. And therefore the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church, and Commonwealth of the Iewes, in the old Teſtament, being ordayned by God himſelf, was Monarchicall, or of one in chief. Which was alſo a Type and figure of the ſame kind of gouernement of the Church of Chriſt, to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the new Teſtament. The originall cauſe therfore and formall reaſon of this kind of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inſtitution in the Church of Chriſt, was the perfect vnity of the members therof, which our Sauiour ſpecially intended: For the which alſo <hi>he prayed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

Peter,</hi> is one with Chriſt; and according to the prayer of our Sauiour to his Father ſaying, <hi>That they may be one, as we are one.</hi> And then
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7997:37"/>followeth in S. Cyprian: <hi>No other Altar or Prieſthood can be eſtabliſhed: whoſoeuer gathereth els where, ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de paſt. c. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> To which purpoſe, S.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7997:38"/>thoſe thinges which by my power are proper to me, by participation with thee, might be made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with thee, and me.</hi> By which wordes theſe holy Fathers labour to declare the vnſpeakable vnity of Chriſt and his Church, teaching how the head thereof in earth, is made one by Gods diuine grace in name, in place, and dignity with the head in heauen.</p>
               <p>For the further explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof you ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the vnity which the Church poſſeſſeth by this means, doth eſpecially conſiſt in 3. thinges: the firſt, is vnity of Iuriſdiction, or Iudiciall power, which that it dependeth wholy of one head vpon earth, and of the authority giuen to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proued out of thoſe places of the Fathers, wherein he is acknowledged to haue the Primacy, to be the head Paſtour and gouernour of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall world, which alſo ſhalbe further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed when we come to ſpeake of the Popes ſucceſſion to <hi>S. Peter.</hi> The ſecond is vnity, and conſent in fayth, for the mantainance whereof, that ſolidity and ſtrength, was giuen to the fayth of <hi>Peter,</hi> vpon which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, according to the Scripture, do aknowledg the Church of Chriſt to be built ſo ſtrongly, as that the gates of hell ſhall not preuayle againſt it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his booke <hi>de vaitate Eccleſiae,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing declared, that the Diuell to diminiſh the great mulutude of the beleeuers increaſing ſo faſt, had deniſed Schiſmes and Hereſyes wherby many were blinded and carryed away, diſcouereth the cauſe therof, in theſe words: <hi>This is done</hi> ſayth he, beloued brethren) <hi>becauſe men haue not recourſe to the origine of the truth, neither ſeeking the head, nor following the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7997:38"/>doctrine of their celeſtiall maiſter.</hi> And then expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe, he addeth: <hi>Our Lord ſpeaketh vnto Peter: I ſay vnto thee, Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke &amp;c. And againe, after his reſurrection he ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Feed my ſheep.</hi> In which words this glorious Martyr ſheweth, that according to the doctrine of Chriſt our maiſter, for the finding out of the truth, we muſt haue recourſe to <hi>Peter,</hi> the foundation of the Church, and the Paſtour therof. And thereof he concludeth, that albeit the Apoſtles were all equall in honour and power (that is to ſay of Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) yet the Primacy was giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> that there might be one Church, and one Chayre, &amp; one flock fed by many Paſtors, with one mynd and conſent.</p>
               <p>The like words he alſo vſeth in his epiſtle to Pope Cornelius, where he ſayth:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> ep. <hi>3.</hi> ad Cornel.</note> 
                  <hi>For neither from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cauſe do Hereſyes come vp, or Schiſmes do ariſe, but only from this, that obedience is not giuen to the Priest of God; and that one Priest for the tyme, or one Iudge for the tyme, is not acknowlelged in the Church, in the place of Christ. Whome, if according to the diuine documents of their Maister, the whole fraternity obeyed, no man would (or could) moue any thing at all against the colledge of Priests,</hi> that is to ſay, collected &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder one Prieſt, &amp; one Iudge vpon earth in the place of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>46.</hi> inter epiſt. Cypriani.</note> And Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> himſelfe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſignifieth, that ſome being repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of their Schiſme, which ignorantly they had made againſt him; confeſſed their errours in theſe words. <hi>We know that Cornelius was elected by God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and by Christ our Lord, to be the Biſhop of the holy Catholike Church &amp;c. Our mind was alwayes in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7997:39"/>Catholike Church. For we are not ignorant, that there is one God, one Christ, one holy Ghost, and that in the Catholike Church there ought to be one Biſhop</hi> ſo they. which is the ſame in effect, with the doctrine related out of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelfe, with which confeſſion of theirs, <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſayth, that he was much moued, &amp; willed S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to ſend his letters of the relation thereof to other Churches. And to conclude this poynt, the ſaying of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> is common in euery booke of Controuerſy. <hi>Among the twelue one was chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that an head being establiſhed, the occaſion of ſchiſm might be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly therefore, the vnity of the Church is increaſed and perfected, by the vnity in power of Eccleſiaſticall Order, which as it dependeth of one alone to be rightly conferred: ſo it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that our Sauiour ordayned, it ſhould deſcend from onealone:<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> &amp; ſo I vnderſtand, with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> thoſe words of <hi>Anacletus,</hi> that, <hi>in the new Testament after Christ, the Sacerdotall Order came from Peter:</hi> by which he muſt meane, not the order of Prieſts, who were ordayned by our Sauiour himſelfe in his laſt ſupper, but of Biſhops, who, according to <hi>Anacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> receiued their Epiſcopal ordination from Peter, as Peter receiued the ſame from Chriſt.

                  <hi>From whome</hi> (Peter) <hi>ipſe Epiſcopatus, the Epiſcopall power it ſelfe, and all the authority of this name proceeded.</hi> And againe, <hi>whenſoeuer any matter of fayth is called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; I thinke all our brethren and fellow-Biſhops ſhould defer the ſame to none but to Peter, that is, to the authour of their name and honour.</hi> The like words hath <hi>Iulius</hi>

               <p>AND thus much may ſuffice for the firſt poynt of this Controuerſy, wherein I haue ſhewed, how the Catholikes demonſtrate the Primacy of S. <hi>Peter</hi> by two eſpeciall places of holy Scripture, and by the vniforme conſent and expoſition of the holy Fathers, who thereupon do giue ſuch titles, and appellations to <hi>Peter,</hi> as are giuen to no other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in particuler, but were only communicated by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7997:40"/>Chriſt to <hi>S.

                  <hi>SECTION IX.</hi> The continuance of S. Peters authority is proued by Scripture, and by the Fathers, and by the confeſsion of many Proteſtants: and therof is inferred the ſucceſſion of the Pope to S. Peter.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of the former point, concerning <hi>S. Peters</hi> authority, I ſhewed how the Catholiks conſidered, and diſtinguiſhed a double power in the Apoſtles of Chriſt, the one extraordinary &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall, whereby they had equall Iuriſdiction ouer the Church of Chriſt, which is therfore called Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, becauſe it dyed with them; for if others had ſucceeded them therin, their ſucceſſours alſo by vertue therof, had beene all Apoſtles: The other ordinary, and Epiſcopall, wherein others were to ſucceed them for the gouernement of the Church, and which in <hi>S. Peter</hi> alone, was ſupreme, abſolute, and independant, but in the reſt, it was limitted to particuler places: and therefore albeit, as Apoſtles, they had all equall authority ouer the reſt of the Church, yet they were not equall amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but <hi>S. Peter,</hi> by vertue of his ſupreme Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall authority, was the chiefe Paſtour and head of the reſt. And now likewiſe for your greater light, in the handling of this ſecond poynt, we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7997:42"/>in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> a double Epiſcopall power, the one in particuler, &amp; proper to the dioceſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherof he was the immediate Biſhop, the other vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall ouer the whole Church of Chriſt, whereby albeit he be not the immediate Biſhop of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Churches, yet is he the vniuerſall &amp; ſupreme Paſtour ouer them all. As the Biſhop of Canterbury for example, although he be the immediate Biſhop of Canterbury alone, yet as he is Archbiſhop, he hath the care of thoſe other Churches, and Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of our Nation, which are vnder his charge.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction therefore being granted, firſt there is no queſtion to be made, but that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſucceed vnto S. <hi>Peter</hi> as he was the immediate Biſhop of that Dioceſſe. For this is euident, not only by the catalogue of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and tradition of the Church: but alſo by the teſtimony of all Hiſtoriographers and ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in particuler of <hi>S. Irenaeus, Tertullian, S. Hierome, S. Auguſtine, Optatus,</hi> and others, as we ſhal ſee anone. Which being commonly granted by all the learned Proteſtants, becauſe if the ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> did not dye with him, as the generall power of the Apoſtles ouer the whole Church did ceaſe with them, but remayned and continued in the Church after his death; thereof it would follow, that the Pope who ſucceeded him in the one, ſhould ſucceed him alſo in the other, as he who is made Biſhop of Canterbury is thereby alſo made Archbiſhop and Primate of all the kingdome. For this cauſe diuers Proteſtants haue affirmed, that albeit the Pope do ſucceed to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> as he was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7997:43"/>Biſhop of Rome, yet they deny, that he ſucceeded him in his vniuerſall Paſtorall function, becauſe they ſay, it dyed with him. And therefore on the other ſide, if the Catholikes can ſhew, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth ſtill remayne in the Church; that being proued, there willbe no difficulty, but that the Pope doth ſucceed to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as wel in his Primacy ouer the whole Church, as in his particuler authority ouer the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially no other Biſhop hauing euer pretended, or made claime to that <hi>Succeſsion,</hi> but only the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, that the Primacy of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> was to deſcend and remayne to his ſucceſſors, is proued by theſe two places of Scripture,<note place="margin">Matt. <hi>16.</hi> Ioan. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> alleadged for the proofe of his Supremacy. For in the firſt place, our Sauiour promiſed, that he would make him the foundation, and build his Church vpon him in ſuch manner, as the gates of Hell ſhould not preuayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Whereby as he ſignifieth, that the Church was to remayne and indure perpetually; ſo much more he promiſed, that the Foundation therof was likewiſe to remayne, from whence the Church it ſelfe was to receiue her perpetuall ſtrength, and duration.<note place="margin">origen. in <hi>16.</hi> Matt.</note> Which <hi>Origen</hi> conſidering, ſayd very well; that <hi>it was manifest, albeit not expreſſed, that the gates of Hell cannot preuaile neither against Peter, nor against the Church, for if they preuailed against the Rock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church is founded, they ſhould alſo preuaile against the Church it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like alſo may be eaſily inferred out of the ſecond place, where S. <hi>Peter</hi> was made the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Paſtour of the ſheep of Chriſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7997:43"/>the ſheep of all ages were commended vnto him; and therfore, not only to him in perſon, but alſo to his ſeat, and to his ſucceſſours repreſented, and contayned in him, as in theyr ſeed and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  </note> that in the Church, <hi>there is one God, one Chriſt, one Chayre, founded vpon Peter, one Priest, one Iudge for the tyme, in the place of Christ.</hi> Which is alſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the words of our Sauiour, where he ſayth, <hi>There ſhould be one ſheepfold, and one Pastour.</hi>

                  <hi>Pope of the vniuerſall Church.</hi> And in the Breuiary of <hi>Liberatus</hi> we read, that <hi>none is Pope ouer the Church of the whole world, but only the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſucceſſion of the Pope to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the ſupreame authority of the Roman Church in regard thereof, is proued by the Councells; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a long treatiſe might be made, but for breuityes ſake, becauſe the Proteſtants ſeeme to reſpect and reuerence, with S <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, the foure firſt generall Councells, as the foure Euangeliſts; and that they are alſo receiued by act of Parliament <hi>anno</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I will alleadge no other but thoſe, and out of them ſo much alone, as may be ſufficient to eſtabliſh the Popes Supremacy: and to let you ſee, That if the Catholikes might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7997:45"/>to any kind of iuſt and equall try all; how eaſily it were for them to claime <hi>Toleration,</hi> &amp; to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the Religion euen by the ſtatutes at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law, which are now in force in England.</p>
               <p>The ſixt Canon therefore, of the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> beginneth in this manner: <hi>The Roman Church hath alwayes had Primacy:</hi> and, <hi>lot the ancient cuſtome contynue in Aegypt, or Lybia, and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapolis; that the Biſhop of Alexandria, haue power ouer them all, wherof</hi> (the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> followeth) <hi>quoniam quidem &amp; Epiſcopo Romano parilis mos eſt,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſheweth very well, that it can beare no other ſenſe, but only this; That the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ought to gouerne thoſe prouinces, becauſe the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath been ſo accuſtomed; that is to ſay, becauſe the Roman Biſhop before this tyme, hath alwayes permitted the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to gouerne thoſe Countreyes, or becauſe he hath alwayes vſed to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them by the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And ſo <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> the firſt, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Michael,</hi> vnderſtood the ſame. Vpon the reading of which Canon of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Iudges in the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell began and ſayd: That <hi>they had well conſidered</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendimus) <hi>all Primacy and chiefe honour to be conſirued according to the Canons, vnto the moſt beloued of God, the Archbiſhop of old</hi> Rome. Where you ſee the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Pope acknowledged, not only in the <hi>Nicen,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Councells; which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the foure firſt, wherein this Canon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyted, and allowed as hath been ſayd.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the third booke of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in the three firſt Canons, taken out of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7997:46"/>Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the firſt, are found theſe words: <hi>Councells ought not to be celebrated,</hi>

                  <hi>without the ſentence of the Roman Biſhop.</hi> And againe: <hi>Biſhops in more weighty cauſes may freely appedle to the Apoſtolike Sea, and ſly thereunto, as to their Mother.</hi> And laſtly: <hi>While the Biſhop of the Apoſtolike Sea doth iudge againe</hi> (that is to ſay vpon appeale) <hi>the cauſe of any Biſhop, no other may be ordayned in his place,</hi> that is then vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tryal. And the reaſon is giuen, <hi>becauſe it is not permitted to end, or define ſuch cauſes, before the Roman Biſhop be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted withall.

               <p>Which laſt poynt of appellation is alſo more fully expreſſed and confirmed in the foruth and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Canon of the generall Councell of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which was celebrated a very ſhort tyme after the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, and is accompted to be as one ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, becauſe the ſame Fathers for the moſt part were preſent in both, &amp; nothing concerning Faith, was added of new in the latter. And therefore, not only <hi>Sozimus,</hi> but alſo <hi>Iulius, Innocentius,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> ſeeme to cite theſe Canons, vnder the name of the Canons of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell. Laſtly, in the 39. Canon of thoſe of <hi>Nice,</hi> tranſlated out of Greeke &amp; Arabick, it is ſayd in this mannor: <hi>A Patriarch is ſo aboue al thoſe that are vnder his power, as he that holdeth the Sea of Rome, is head and Prince of all Patriarches;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7997:46"/>becauſe he is the firſt, as</hi> Peter <hi>was, to whome was giuen power ouer all Chriſtian Princes, and ouer all their people, as he that is the Vicar of Chriſt our Lord, ouer all people, &amp; the vniuerſall Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church. And whoſoeuer ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it, is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by the Synod.</hi> See the notes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Canon, in the firſt Tome of the Councells, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Binnius.</hi> And ſo much for the <hi>Nicen</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Councell was that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where in the 3. <hi>alias</hi> 5. Canon, it is ſaid, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople ſhould haue the Primacy of honour after the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhop:</hi> wherby it is ſuppoſed as a thing moſt certayne, and a thing out of queſtion; that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhop had the Primacy, not only in honour, but alſo in Gouerment and Iuriſdiction, wherof the Councell ſpeaketh in that place, as appeareth out of the ſecond Canon next preceding. The other part of this Canon, was not receiued for many hundred yeares after, becauſe it was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (which alſo proueth his Primacy) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at laſt the Roman Church conſented, &amp; then it began to take offect, as is manifeſt in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of <hi>Lateran.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>5.</hi> hiſt. c. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> Alſo the ſame Councell in their Epiſtle to Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> which is extant in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> do ſay; that <hi>they met togeather at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>by the commandement of the Popes letters ſent vnto them by the Emperour,</hi> wherein they further acknowledge the Roman Church, to be the <hi>head, and they the members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third generall Councell was that of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Fathers whereof in their Epiſtle to Pope <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> acknowledge <hi>the Popes care of them, for fincerity in matter of Faith, to be moſt gratefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto the Sauiour of all.</hi> And ſay; that <hi>they imbrare
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7997:47"/>it with all a miration and reuerence:</hi> and that <hi>it was the cuſtome of thoſe, in that high place</hi> (Vobis tam eximijs in more poſitum) <hi>to be renowned in all things, and to moke their ſtuddyes, the ſolide ſtayes, and grounds of Churches.</hi> Wherein alſo they ſayd, that <hi>neceſsity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired they ſhould declare to his Holynes, all things which had paſſed in that Councell,</hi> ſhewing thereby their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the Roman Biſhop. And when the whole Councell had applauded the Popes letters, and followed his inſtructions, and that the Legates, comming in afterwards, had vnderſtood the ſame, one of them,<note place="margin">Tomo. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> called Philip, thanked them; that <hi>with there pious voices and acclamations, they had ſubmitted themſelues, as holy members, to their holy head. For,</hi> ſayth he; <hi>your happynes is not ignorant, that the Bleſſed Apoſtle</hi> Peter, <hi>was the head of the whole Fayth, and of all the reſt of the Apoſtles.</hi> And further he ſaith, that Peter was <hi>the Vicar of Chriſt, conſtituted by him, and that he yet liued in his ſucceſſour:</hi> and that, <hi>his ſucceſſor and holy Vicar was the Roman Biſhop:</hi> which ſpeaches, the ſacred Synode, was ſo far from deteſting, that ſhewing conformity in the ſame fayth, they ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with them.<note place="margin">Euag. lib. <hi>1.</hi> hiſt. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Alſo the ſame Councell, as <hi>Euagrius</hi> recordeth, affirmed, that it depoſed <hi>Neſtorius (ex man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato) by a commandement of the Popes letters.</hi> And the Fathers thereof in their Epiſtle to the Pope do write: that <hi>they preſumed not to determine the cauſe of</hi> Iohn <hi>Patriarch of Antioch, which was more doubtfull then the cauſe of</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>but that they reſerued the ſame to the Pope himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth generall Councell was that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which confirmed the ſixth Canon of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7997:47"/>the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> concerning the Primacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as you haue heard. The ſuperſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the letters, or petitions to the Councell (all or many) were in this forme: <hi>To the moſt holy, and the moſt Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

In the beginning wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> ſaid in this manner: <hi>we haue in our hands the precepts of the moſt Bleſſed, and moſt Apoſtolike man, the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>who is head of all Churches, whereby his Apoſtleſhip hath pleaſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, that</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>the Archbiſhop of the</hi> Alexandrians, <hi>ſhould not ſit in the Councell,</hi> &amp; all the Councell obayed. And afterwards the letters of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> being read,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> all the Fathers of the Councell ſayd, <hi>ſo we belieue; Peter hath ſpoken ſo by Leo.</hi> And in the third action, <hi>Leo</hi> is often called <hi>vniuerſall Patriarch, and vniuerſall Archbiſhop.</hi> And <hi>Iutianus</hi> one of the Biſhops, ſayd vnto one of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes Legates: that <hi>they held the Primacy of the moſt holy</hi> Leo, and deſired them, as <hi>holding his place, to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt Dioſcorus,</hi> wherunto the Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and ſentence was giuen accordingly in the Popes name againſt him. In which Councell alſo <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> who was depoſed by a Synod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> being reſtored by the Pope, was admitted to enter with theſe words: <hi>Let the moſt reuerend B.</hi> Theodoret <hi>come in, and be made partaker of the Councell, becauſe the moſt holy Archbiſhop</hi> Leo <hi>hath reſtored his Biſhoprick vnto him.</hi> S. Thomas of Aquin recitoth out of the ſame Councell, the confirmation of appeales, of all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7997:48"/>Biſhops accuſed of any great cryme to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>other things defined by him ſhould be held or receiued, as from the Vicar of the Apoſtolike Throne:</hi> and that the whole Councel made this acclamation to Pope Leo; <hi>Let the moſt holy. Apoſtolike, and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Patriarch liue many yeares.</hi> Laſtly, the ſame Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in their Epiſtle to <hi>Leo,</hi> confeſſe him to be their head, and they the members; &amp; ſpeaking of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of Eutiches; <hi>after all this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ouer and aboue, he extended his madnes, euen against him, to whom the cuſtody of the vineyard was committed by our Sauiour (that is) againſt thy Apoſtolicall Holynes: and he thought to excommunicate thee, that doeſt haſten to vnite the body of the Church.</hi> And in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion with many faire words, they deſire him to grant vnto them, that the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> might haue the ſecond place, after the Apoſtolike Sea: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he would not grant them, nor was it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ſucceſſours, for a long tyme after.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the foure firſt generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells, which they that receiue them according to the Statute, muſt needs grant, that the Pope hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had Primacy; that he is the ſucceſſor to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> the head of the whole fayth, &amp; of all the reſt of the Apoſtles, and the vicar of Chriſt, &amp; the like: That his care and ſtudy, is the ground and foundation of the Church; that he is the vniuerſall Archbiſhop &amp; head of the Church; that no Councells ought to be celebrated without his ſentence; that it is neceſſary the Councells ſhould declare vnto him what paſſed in them; that whatſoeuer he defined, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as from the vicar of Chriſt; That cauſes of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7997:48"/>great difficulty muſt be referred vnto him; that all Biſhops may appeale vnto him, &amp; to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to their Mother; that he commaundeth in Councells; that he may depoſe Patriarches, &amp; reſtore them that be depoſed. And laſtly, that the decrees of Councells take no effect, without his confent and confirmation.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION XI.</hi> The Popes Supremacy is proued out of the point of the infallibility of his doctrine, by the Authorityes of the ancient Fathers.</head>
               <p>FOVRTHLY therefore, the Catholikes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this doctrine of the Popes Supremacy, produce the authorityes of all the ancient Fathers, <hi>nubem testium,</hi> a bright and great cloud of witneſſes to inlighten the obſcurity of fayth, in this vale of darknes. Which if I ſhould go about to ſet downe at large, I ſhould be infinite. Wherefore to contract this copious matter, I will alleadg ſome of thoſe who teach, that the authority of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as vnited with the Pope, ought to be receiued in matters of Faith; whereof it muſt needs follow, that the Pope ſucceedeth S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that, as vpon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in reſpect of his faith, ſo alſo in his place vpon the Pope the Church is ſo built in ſuch manner, as that the gates of Hell ſhall not preuayle againſt it.</p>
               <p>But before I begin, I would haue you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that it is all one to affirme the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7997:49"/>be the Rocke of the Church, or the Pope to ſucceed S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Paſtorall Office, or to giue vnto the Pope any of thoſe titles, which are proper to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as to ſay expreſly, that neither the one, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can fayle in teaching the true faith, becauſe theſe former aſſertions, and the like do imply, that the promiſe made vnto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> doth belong alſo to the Pope &amp; his ſeat, and that the fayth or doctrine, which the Pope teacheth, can ſuffer no defect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to the words of our Sauiour, the ſtability and duration of the Church dependeth of it. And therefore it is manifeſt, that the Fathers do ſignify thereby, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not only the true Church in their dayes, or that the Pope did not teach any falſe doctrine in their times, as ſome Proteſtants ſeeme to vnderſtand them; but alſo that the truth was alwayes to continue therein, and that the Pope could neuer erre in matter of Fayth, grounding themſelues, as I haue ſayd, vpon the promiſe of Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and that you may not doubt of this, I thought good to proue the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Pope out of the infalibility of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the Fathers acknowledge to be inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the Pope, and ſea of Rome.</p>
               <p>The firſt that I thinke fit to produce in this matter is the great <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who withſtood himſelfe alone, the force and fury of foure Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and ſuſtained the perſecution of all the <hi>Arian</hi> heretikes, and (a man may ſay) of all the Eaſterne world againſt him. He was Patriarch of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, at that tyme the ſecond ſeat after <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; was a principall man both in the Councell of Nice, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7997:49"/>alſo in that of <hi>Sardis.</hi> In which ſacred Schooles in reſpect of his excellent vertues, it might perchance be truly ſayd, that he deſerued the place of a maiſter. But it is prayſe ſufficient, that he ſhewed himſelfe a moſt renowned ſcholer of thoſe renowned maiſters. He therfore that had receiued the ſpirit of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, and wrote according to the ſenſe and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Fathers therof, ſaluted Marke the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in this manner:<note place="margin">Athan. ep. ad Marc.</note> 
                  <hi>To our moſt holy Lord venerable with Apostolicall dignity, Marke, the Father of the holy, Roman, and Apostolicall ſeat, and of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church, Athanaſius &amp; the Biſhops of Eaſt health,</hi> and afterwards in his letters, he acknowledgeth <hi>the Roman Church, to be the Mother of all Churches;</hi> and vſeth alſo theſe words: <hi>We are yours, and vnto you, with all thoſe committed to our charge, we are obedient, and euer will be.</hi> And in his epiſtle to <hi>Felix</hi> the ſecond, he with the other Biſhops of <hi>Aegipt</hi> do ſay,<note place="margin">In tom. <hi>1.</hi> Concil.</note> that they ſuggeſt to his holy Apoſtleſhip, that it would pleaſe him, according to his cuſtome to haue care of them; <q>that they and theiranceſtors had receiued help from his holy Apoſtolike ſeat; that according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Canons, they beſeech the ſayd Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, &amp; higheſt ſeat, to giue them help, from whence their Predeceſſours had receiued ordinations, rules of doctrine, and other helpes; that they haue recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vnto the Roman Church, as to their Mother; that he was Peter, and vpon his foundation the pillars of the Church, that is the Biſhops (ſay they) are ſet and confirmed, that they preſume not without his counſell to define any matter of fayth, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons commaunding, that without the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7997:50"/>in the more weighty cauſes, nothing ought to be determyned;</q> that the iudgment of all Biſhops is committed to his ſeat.

And therfore no doubt, all thoſe ſhallbe inexcuſable before God, that continuing obſtinate in their owne opinions, do either reiect or contemne it.</p>
               <p>And truly, if it might be permitted vnto vs, to plead the ſtatute of the firſt yeare of Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> whereby the foure firſt generall Councells were approued, and made to be Law: and that we

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:7997:66"/>
               <p>Neither is this moſt peſtilent aſſertion of the Biſhop contrary to Scripture alone, and to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councells, as hath been ſhewed, but alſo to the practiſe and doctrine of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. For I would aske this wild Biſhop, whether the authority the Engliſh Biſhops, in their ſpirituall Courts be from God or no? If it be, then according to S. Paul, all men are bound to obey them, in that which is iuſt, vpon paine of damnation. If it be not, then it is no ſmall vſurpation in them, to take vpon them ſuch authority: whereof the Biſhop ſhould do well, to admoniſh them as his friends, before he go about to reforme the Catholike Biſhops, whome he ſuppoſeth to be his enemyes. In concluſion, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Iuriſdiction is ſo euident in it ſelfe, and the inſtitution thereof ſo palpable in Scripture, that the Puritans themſelues, who deny the ſame to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, are inforced notwithſtanding to challenge ſo much to themſelues, as may ſuffice to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all thoſe, who are obſtinatly diſobedient in their Congregations. And therefore I thinke there is none but himſelfe ſo drunke at this day with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy in Chriſtendome, as to deny the lawfullnes of all Iuriſdiction in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>And as this poſition is moſt pernicious to all kind of Churches, or ſpirituall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be, in taking away al obligation of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from them; ſo alſo, it is moſt dangerous to kingdomes and commonwealthes: for ſuch as in our tyme, haue oppoſed themſelues to the Iuriſdiction of the Church, haue likewiſe for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed their band of obedience to all temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7997:66"/>And their principall ground or reaſon is the ſame in both: For no man, ſay they, that ſeeth not another mans conſcience, can bind the conſcience of his brother: And that all being made free by Baptiſme, ought to enioy the liberty of the Ghoſpell. Whereof it followeth, that neither ſonnes, nor ſeruants, nor wyues, nor ſubiects, are bound to obay their Superiours for conſcience ſake, but only, and at the moſt, either for feare, or els for the auoyding of ſome publike ſcandall: which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if it were once receiued, would in ſhort ſpace make Chriſtians worſe then Heathens.</p>
               <p>And therefore, I marueile how your Engliſh Biſhops, could let ſuch doctrine paſſe, being no leſſe contrary to their authority, then to the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and no leſſe perillous to themſelues, then to the gouernement of the whole kingdome; vnles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, finding their caſe to be deſperate, they deſire more to offend their enemy, then to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent their hereſy ſhould ſinke, ſo the Catholike Religion might be drowned with it. But the Biſhop being reputed to haue gotten ſome learning, when he was yong, and not being yet ſo old as to dote for age; aboue all it is to be marueiled, how he could ſuſter himſelf to be ſo much deceiued by the Diuell, as to ground his 10. yeares ſtudyes, (the 10. books of his Chriſtian commonwealth, and in a word his whole religion, and the ſaluation of his ſoule) vpon an abſurdity ſo groſſe, ſo fowle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous, &amp; dangerous to Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth as this is: and the ſtrangenes of his illuſion, is ſo much the greater, becauſe he was ſo blinded
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7997:67"/>therewith, that he ſaw not how manifeſtly he was inforced to contradict himſelfe, not only in other places of this his booke, where he gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes haue power to do many thinges in the Church, and challengeth vnto himſelfe I know not what authority ouer Biſhops in ſome caſes (which ſhould make the Biſhop of Canterbury to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him:) but alſo in the very title of his Booke, which he calleth his Eccleſiaſticall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, becauſe it doth inuolue a manifeſt contradiction, to this his ſtrange poſition. For vnles it be meerly a dreame, and much more fantaſticall, then <hi>Platoes Idaea,</hi> no man can imagine, how any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth ſhould be framed, or eſt abliſhed without ſome Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or power of gouernement giuen thereunto.</p>
               <p>If he had contayned himſelfe within any reaſonable bounds, and relyed his proofes vpon the Scripture alone, interpreting the ſame according to his own ſenſe, how ſtrang ſoeuer; he might perhaps haue made ſome ſhift therewith for a while, as his fellowes haue done before him. But to pretend and contend, as he doth, that according to the Fathers, Councells, and Canons, there is neither ſuperiority of gouernment in the head, nor power of Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the body of Chriſts Church, is an euident ſigne, that as he hath forſaken God, ſo alſo God in his iuſtice, hath not only forſaken him, but alſo in great part hath taken his wits and reaſon from him. For as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth of the Propheſyes of the Church, that they are more cleere in Scripture, then the propheſyes of Chriſt himſelfe, becauſe the tryall of all other Controuerſyes, dependeth: vpon the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7997:67"/>knowledge of the Church: ſo alſo for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God Almighty in his prouidence hath ſo orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Iuriſdiction of the Church, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the head therof, ſhould be more expreſly taught, and aboundantly proued by the Doctours, Paſtours, and ancient Fathers, then any other point in Controuerſy. So that he might better haue gone about to proue and maintayne out of the Fathers Canons, or Councells, that the Sonne is not equall with the Father, or the holy Ghoſt not equall to the Sonne, or not proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, or that our Bleſſed Lady ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Mother of God, or ſome other of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently condemned and rotten hereſyes; then to proue, that there is no Iuriſdiction in the Church, nor any inequality of gouernment amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours thereof. And therefore, as moſt impudently he denyeth the latter, ſo it is much to be feared, that he faltereth alſo in the former, whereof he giueth many ſhrewd ſignes, and apparant tokens in this little booke; and much more is it likely he will bewray himſelf in the greater whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it cometh forth. For being borne vpon the confines of <hi>Turky,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> in which Countrey thoſe ancient hereſyes haue tirannized heeretofore, and worſe ſucceeded them in latter ages; the ſuſpitions wherewith (as he profeſſeth) he was troubled when he was yong, by all reaſon were more in fauour of the Eaſterne hereſyes, which he knew, then of theſe of the Weſt, which he knew not. And the bookes of the <hi>Arian</hi> &amp; <hi>Greciin</hi> hereſyes, being no leſſe forbidden in Italy, then the hereticall writers of theſe weſterne parts,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7997:68"/>whereby his ſuſpitions were much more increaſed, it is very probable, that they ſwayed his mind more to that ſide, then to this.</p>
               <p>His maiſters alſo, do commonly diſpute more againſt them, then againſt theſe, whome they are content to pretermit, in theſe parts, there being no vſe of the knowledge of them. And therefore by al likelihood his ſuſpitions increaſed moſt in fauour of thoſe opinions, whereunto he was naturally moſt affected, and wherewith he had more to do, and which did more belong vnto him to know, then the other did. And beſides all this, that which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his chiefe quarrell againſt the Pope, is only the excommunication and condemnation of thoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for hereſyes, which he ſayth are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently condemned by the Church; although it be manifeſt, and he denyeth it not, that they haue byn condemned by generall Councells. And that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne deſire of peace,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>35.</hi>
                  </note> and vnity, which he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the Eaſt and Weſt, ſeemeth to conſiſt in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but only in permitting euery Biſhop, at the leaſt, to abound in his owne ſenſe, and to hold what he liſt, as long as he doth not ſeparate himſelfe from the reſt, nor condemne their opinions.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to returne to the matter, which we haue in hand, by taking away all Iuriſdiction from the Church of God, he maketh voyd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth the <hi>Anathema,</hi> and excommunication of all former heretikes: and by condemning the Fathers and Councells, for condemning them without iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall authority, he reſtoreth them all to their firſt pretended pleas, and old forged titles, And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7997:68"/>of theſe ancient cenſures &amp; condemnations of Heretikes by the Churche of Rome at this day, I take to be ſome part of thoſe innumerable hereſyes, whereof he accuſeth the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be euery day an authour; for otherwiſe that monſtrous <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> of his could haue no proportion: and within the number of thoſe other very many Churches, which heere he ſayth, that Rome hath vniuſtly made her aduerſaries, muſt be contayned, not only thoſe of the Weſt, which are but two or three notoriouſly knowne, but alſo the other of the Eaſt, that is to ſay, the Grecians and Arians at the leaſt, if the Turkes and Iewes do not alſo come in, to make vp the reckoning of ſo great a number.</p>
               <p>The fury of Hereſy being now ouerblowne, wherewith it entred firſt into our miſerable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the Kingdome hauing been a long tyme ſetled in a repoſed kind of gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, many ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of good iudgment, and well affected to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do wonder to ſee, that it receiueth with try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, all kind of Fugitiues, and Apoſtata Fryars, that come running thither, of what life, or what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſoeuer they be, ſo long as they profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues enemyes to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which many wiſe men, our friends, who are lookers on, eſteeme and affirme, to be no leſſe diſhonorable then dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to any well ordered, and well gouerned ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And in very deed, what reputation I pray you, can it giue vnto you, in the eye of your Neighbour Countreys, to ſee the ſcumme, and vomit of other Nations, and their Religious Orders to be ſo much eſteemed and magnifyed among you? or what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7997:69"/>can they make either of your zeale in religion, or wiſedome in gouernement; that open your armes to euery Sectary, and your pulpits to euery renegate pretending to preach, although his conuerſation, his intention, his priuate opinions, or the cauſe of his comming, be neuer ſo much vnknowne vnto you? And at this tyme, I pray God it proue not too true, that in the ſhape of a Biſhop, you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a moſt venomous, and peſtiferous ſerpent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your boſome. For albert as yet he doth not ſhew his head by diſcouering his opinions in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer poynts of Chriſtian Religion (making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of malice againſt the Pope alone:) yet in the windings &amp; turnings of this little booke (as I haue ſhewed) and eſpecially in deſtroying all iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in arrogating to his owne iudgment aboue meaſure, and in challenging liberty to abound in his owne ſenſe, he diſcouereth a moſt fearefull and deformed body. For, if this which he pretendeth, may be permitted to himſelfe and others, there is no poynt of Religion, which will not preſently be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion: euery thing wilbe made a quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; &amp; as the Academikes in Philoſophy, ſo you alſo in Diuinity, muſt hold all things probable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall: whereof it will ſhortly follow, that as all the wiſedome of the Academy, was ſummed in this one ſentence, <hi>Hoc tantùm ſcio, quòd nihil ſcio;</hi> ſo the Religion of England wilbe wholy reduced to this one article, <hi>hoc tantùm credo, quòd nihil credo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the danger hereof is the greater at this tyme, becauſe as I vnderſtand it is an opinion grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into faſhion among you, that a man may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7997:69"/>in any Religion, ſo he belieue in Chriſt: and I haue ſeene one of your principall Doctours cyted,<note place="margin">D. Morton in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the kingdome of Iſrael. pag. <hi>94.</hi>
                  </note> who durſt to publiſh in prynt; that an <hi>Arian</hi> might be ſaued, becauſe albeit he deny the Deumity of Chriſt, yet he confeſſeth Chriſt to be the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: which your Doctour thinketh ſufficient for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. From whence, euery man being permitted to abound in his owne ſenſe, as the Biſhop would haue it, your ſelfe may iudge, how eaſy a matter it is to paſſe a little further, and to thinke that it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to hold, that Chriſt was a great Prophet, as the Turkes do, or that it is indifferent to belieue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be come or no, which diſpoſeth to Iudaiſme; or that a morall life may be ſufficient to ſaue vs in any Religion, which is playne Gentility. And if this be the vnion of the Eaſt and Weſt, and of the North and South, which the Biſhop ſo much deſireth to eſtabliſh in his Eccleſiaſticall Common Wealth; I am ſure, that none but the Diuell can be the head therof: and to ſatisfy the mans ambition, if it were to do him good, I ſhould be contented for my part, that he himſelfe ſhould be made the Vicar. But thus you ſee, how ſuch as once fall from the Catholike Church, which is the body, do eaſily contemne the head thereof, who is Chriſt himſelfe, and come to looſe not only their dewine faith, which none can haue but they that belieue the true Church: but alſo to renounce their morall beliefe, and former perſuaſion of that truth of Chriſtianity, wherin they were bred; which hitherto God be thanked, hath been conſtantly mayntained in our Countrey.</p>

               <p>FOR this important conſideration, and to meete with the danger of Neutrality in Religion, ſo faſt increaſing in our Countrey; as I fynd it moſt eaſy, ſo I thinke it moſt neceſſary, in theſe deſperate tymes, to make ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation of theſe idle dreams and ſottiſh illuſions of the Diuell, by ſhewing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the rule of Fayth, and according to the ground of naturall reaſon, that no man can be ſaued without the perfect loue of God: which requyreth perfect obedience, both of the vnderſtanding in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the Catholike Church, whome God hath appoynted to teach vs; and alſo of the will in keping Gods Precepts, and Commaundements. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were a medicyne moſt appropriate to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the tyme, and a hatchet layd to that root, from whence the Biſhops tree is already ſprung, and which ſpreadeth a pace, in the harts, not only of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7997:70"/>the idle youth, which I feare, but alſo of thoſe that take themſelues to be the wiſeſt men in our Countrey.</p>
               <p>But becauſe, I am loath to be ouer trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at this tyme, and that this Treatiſe requyreth ſome haſt, which growing in my hand from a letter to a booke, ſhould haue been diſpatched long ſince, not only to giue iuſt contentment to your ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting my anſwere to your letter: but alſo to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy others, who hauing hard: the Biſhops tale, keep one eare open all this while to heare the reply of the contrary party; I will reſerue the handling of this matter for a freſher pen, and for this tyme I will coment my ſelfe with thoſe authorityes which I haue a leady produced out of the Fathers, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch, as are not vnited with the Pope, <hi>it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the ſucceſsion of his ſeat, built vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our Saniour,</hi> to be <hi>propbane,</hi> to be <hi>out of the Arke,</hi>

For the which I reſerre me to the 14. and 15. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this treatiſe. Wherunto ſhall be added more anone, when by occaſion of theſe friuolous motions and illuſions, which made the Biſhop to forſake his religion, we come to propound ſome of thoſe ſolid, and ſubſtantiall motiues, which are ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any man, that is not willfully obſtinate, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Gatholike. And for the preſent, becauſe he ſeemeth to ſet downe the mayne ground of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorſion, or conuerſion (as you pleaſe to tearme it)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7997:71"/>in thoſe words eſpecially, where he ſaith, That rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Fathers, and peruſing the Councells, and ancient cuſtomes of the Church, with great labour and buſy diligence, for ſo many yeares togeather, he plainly ſaw at the length, that the doctrine of thoſe Churches, being very many in number, which <hi>Rome</hi> hath made her aduerſaryes, do little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differ from the ancient doctrine of the pure Church; the diſcuſſion hereof will alſo fall out to be very fit for our preſent purpoſe, wherin you ſhall heare the Fathers vtterly to condemne the Religion now commonly profeſſed in England, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelues not only to reiect the Fathers, but alſo moſt ſpitefully to inueigh, &amp; moſt grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cenſure one the other. For that man, whome neither the Authority of the Fathers, nor the teſty-monyes of his owne Doctors, can moue or perſuade, neither if one ſhould be ſent from the dead toaffright him, would be thereby conuerted.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, that you may as yet more fully perceiue the vanity and impudency of this man, in affirming that all the Fathers are directly for him, albeit he proue nothing: I will take the paynes to ſhew you by ſome generall arguments, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do manifeſtly make againſt him. Firſt therfore you muſt know, that the Catholikes prefeſſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Conſent of the Fathers, or the doctrine of a few not contradicted by the reſt, to be a rule of faith; and that all men are bound vpon payne of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to belieue it: whoſe authority, as the Proteſtants will not receiue, ſo the Catholikes would not admit in ſuch abſolute manner, if they were not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7997:71"/>that their religion were all one with the faith of the Pathers. In confirmation wherof, ſome indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and zealous men amongſt vs, haue made certayne bookes of common places, vnder the titles of the poynts in Controuerſy betwixt vs and them, wherin they hade recorded the ſayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in approbation of our doctrine. And therfore they call them the Confeſſions of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So haue you the confeſſion of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in one volume; of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in another. So likewiſe of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and others, which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any Proteſtant to ſee, but he muſt needs confeſſe, that the Fathers were all Papiſts; and that they haue ſaid ſo much in the proofe and defence of our opinions, as all that we can bring, is but taken from them.</p>

                  <hi>THIS Condemnation and Cenſure of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant doctrine by the voyce of the Fathers,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7997:76"/>being of ſuch great force, as well for the gayning of any well meaning ſoule, who is not will fully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, but of the nuber of thoſe that ſhalbe laued; as alſo for the eternal confuſion of others, who with intollerable pride of mind, and preſumption of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit condemne the vniforme conſent of Fathers, to iuſtify their owne opinions; it hath pleaſed God, that it ſhould be ſo confirmed, by the teſtimonyes and confeſſions of the Proteſtants themſelues, that neither the braſen face of this Biſhop, nor of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though more ſhameleſſe and impudent then the Diuell himſelfe, ſhould be able to make doubt of it, or to call it againe into queſtion.

                  <hi>SECTION XIX.</hi> That the Protestants diſſent very much from the doctrine of the pure Church, is proued out of the Proteſtants themſelues, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one another.</head>
               <p>LIKE as a peece of earth deuyding it ſelfe from a high Mountayne, and falling downe, is againe deuyded into many peeces wherunto it breaketh: or, as the Kingdome of this world, which was giuen by God to our Father Adam, being ſeparated by him from the obedience, and from the Kingdome of God, fell preent; thereupon into many factions, and was afflicted with many contrarietyes, of Angells, and men, and beaſts, and Elements, and the foure hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the body, and of ſenſe, and reaſon, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, ſo it fareth with thoſe that deuide themſelues from the vnity of the Citty, ſet vpon the mountayne, and from the Kingdome of God, which is the Church of Chriſt. For now being deſtitute of that publick and inuincible authority, which Chriſt hath ordayned, to keep the members of his body in which they muſt needs deuyde themſelues one from another, euery man abounding in his owne ſenſe, and in the ſelf pleaſing loue of his owne iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. The examples whereof, haue been ſuch in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7997:78"/>this miſerable age; as nothing is more to be admyred or lamented, then to ſee ſo many Sects, and diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſityes of opinions in theſe tymes, as perchance do ſurmount the number of all the hereſyes of former ages put togeather. The moſt notorious heere with vs, are the Lutherans, the Proteſtants the Puritans, and the Browniſts.<note place="margin">Proteſt. Apology. pag. <hi>502.503 504.684.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> differ from other Proteſtants, in 33. ſeuerall articles, whereof in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler haue written <hi>Schluſſelburg, Oſiander,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Haberus.</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> are againe ſubdeuided into very many ſects: and the Proteſtants into more then ſeauenty ſeuerall opinions of moſt important matters, the moſt of them ſet downe by M. Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> in his meditation vpon the 122. <hi>Pſal.</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted anno 1603. pag. 91.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as ſinne is puniſhed with it ſelfe: ſo it is the nature of falſhood to ouerthrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found it ſelfe. Which as it appeareth to be true, in the infinite contrariety and confuſion of doctrine, among the Proteſtants themſelues: ſo alſe, it wilbe manifeſt in the bold aſſertion of this vayne man, which we haue now in hand. And therefore hauing ſhewed already that to be moſt contrary to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which he ſayth he hath found in the Fathers, and that both by the teſtimony of the Fathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Proteſtants doctrine for hereſy, and alſo by the Proteſtants themſelues, who ſpare not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle, and blaſpheme the Fathers; before I conclude this whole matter, you ſhall alſo heare both him and them condemned out of their owne mouthes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, ſuppoſing that our Biſhop is now a perfect Engliſh Proteſtant: and that he belieueth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7997:78"/>his owne words to be true, affirming <hi>thoſe Charches, which Rome hath made her aduerſaryes, to differ little or nothing from the ancient, pure, and true doctrine of the Church of Christ,</hi> I argue in this manner.</p>
               <p>The Church, which followeth <hi>Luthers</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Luth. tom. Witemb. f. <hi>381.382.</hi>
                  </note> differeth little or nothing from the pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt: But Luther &amp; his diſciples teach, <hi>that all Sacramentaries,</hi> or ſuch as deny, Chriſt to be taken with the mouth in the bleſſed Sacrament, <hi>are Heretikes, alienated from the Church of God, who driue away, and kill the ſheep of Chritt: that their errour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioan. Schutz in <hi>50.</hi> Canſ. in praefat. Tigurni in prafat. Apol. Tig. tract. <hi>3.</hi> cont. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premam Luth. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes. p. <hi>61.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is a blaſphemous defence of many horrible hereſyes; an abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the power and truth of Chriſt, and a preparation to Neſtorianiſme, Arianiſme, and Turciſme. That their breaſt is inſathanized, ſuperſathanized, &amp; perſathanized, that their mouth is oueruled by Sathan, being infuſed, perfuſed, and transfuſed into the ſame.</hi> Therefore it differeth little or nothing from the pure doctrine of Chriſt, to hold the Biſhop and is fellowes, who are Sacramentaryes to be heretiks, alienated from God, deceiuers and killers of the ſheep of Chriſt &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I argue in this manner,<note place="margin">Caluin. in admonit. vlt. ad Weſtfalu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; cont. Hesſhuſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> according to the doctrine of Caluin, which differeth nothing from the purity of the Ghoſpell. <hi>Such as refuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimne the opinions of Luther, are malepers, wicked, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious heretikes, and ſlaues of the Diuell.</hi> But the Biſhop doth not <hi>condemne the opinion of Luther,</hi> therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that doctrine, which differeth nothing from the purity of the Ghoſpell, the Biſhop is a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepert, wicked, furious heretike &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly in the behalfe of the Puritans, I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus. The doctrine of the Puritans according to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7997:79"/>the Biſhop, differeth nothing from the purity of the Ghoſpell. But the Puritans affirme<note n="(e)" place="margin">Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi> &amp; <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants put no difference betwixt truth and falſeſhood, Chriſt and Antichrist, God and the Diuell; that their Clergy are an Antichriſtian ſwyniſh rabble, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of the Ghoſpell.</hi> Therefore it differeth nothing from the purity of the Ghoſpell, to affirme, that the Biſhop being a Proteſtant, <hi>putteth no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt truth and falſhood, Chriſt and Antichriſt, God and the Diuell &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſhort,<note place="margin">Bernard Miniſter of VVorſop in his book of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſts Schiſme p. <hi>71.</hi>
                  </note> in the behalfe of the Browniſts, his other yonger brethren, I argue thus. The Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts according to the Biſhop, do not diſſent from the purity of the Ghoſpel: But the Browniſts affirme, <hi>that the Miniſters of the Church of England, are Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian inchanters, lymms of the Diuell, Sycophants, Angels of hell, an Antichriſtian Clergy.</hi> Therfore it differeth little or nothing from the purity of the Ghoſpell, to affirme; that the Biſhop, being now a Miniſter of the Church of England, <hi>is an Aegiptian inchanter, a limme of the Diuell, a Sicophant &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, in the behalfe of the Proteſtants againſt the Puritans, I argue thus. The Proteſtants doctrine according to the Biſhop, differeth little or nothing from the purity of the Ghoſpell.

               <p>AND this much concerning the Biſhops Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and the formall Reaſons of his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which I haue ſhewed, that being in themſelues, not only ſtrang but alſo incredible, he neither goeth about to proue in this place, nor can poſſibly proue them in his other bookes hereafter: becauſe in them he doth not deſcend to thoſe particuler points which are in Controuerſy betwene vs, as is manifeſt by the titles of his bookes themſelues. And this one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy alone, of the Popes Supremacy, according to the doctrine of the ancient Church I which is the ſubſtance of all the bookes he promiſeth, is found (as I haue ſhewed) to he moſt extreme againſt him: and that which he maketh the ground thereof, hath been alſo diſcouered to be a moſt abſurd, and moſt pernicious poſition, as much contrary to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your Biſhops, and to the Puritan Elderſhip, and to the title of his owne booke, as to the Popes Supremacy: and if all were true which he pretendeth to proue in his Common wealth, it might ſhew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the Catholike Religion to be falſe, but yours to be the right it could not proue.</p>
               <p>I haue alſo made it euident vnto you, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7997:81"/>the Biſhops motiues as they are heere ſet downe in his little booke, are as monſtrous vntruths as can be deuiſed: and albeit he may ſaue them from broad lyes perchance, vnder the title of ſome rhetoricall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, whereof he hath been a Maiſter: yet too much of one thing is good for nothing, and he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that it is a great diſgrace, euen to the Art of lying to vſe this one figure of manifeſt vntruth ſo often.</p>
               <p>By this alſo that hath beene ſayd concerning this matter, you will further perceiue (the Biſhop being a man ſo deeply learned, and after ten yeares ſtudy, hauing produced ſuch reaſons as theſe for the proofe of your Religion) how hard, or rather how impoſſible it is, for any man whatſoeuer, to giue any ſound, or good reaſon for it. Wherin alſo by the way it wilbe worthy your knowledge to conſider, that ſuch reaſons as may induce a man to be of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are of two ſorts. For either they proue euery point of Religion in particuler to be true, or els they open, and declare the euidence of certaine generall principles, which being once receiued, draw after them the conſent of the mind to all thoſe thinges in ſpeciall, which are taught or practiſed in that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Vnto the firſt kind do belong all thoſe books, which treat of particuler Controuerſyes, as of the Maſſe; of prayer for the dead; of prayer to Saints; Purgatory; and the like, which indeed to a man that hath but little will, or little leaſure to read, is a weariſome courſe, and tedious way to tryall. Vnto the other doth belong thoſe ſhorter diſcourſes which ſome haue tearmed motiues, and for the Catholike
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7997:82"/>party, may be ſeen in ſuch as haue handled the notes of the Church, in <hi>Canipian his ten Reaſons,</hi> in the booke of the <hi>Three Conuerſions of England,</hi> in <hi>Briſtow,</hi> and others. Whereunto beſides, that they muſt be generall reaſons as I haue ſhewed, two things againe are neceſſary. The one, that the truth of them be more euident then the truth of other particulers, which depend vpon them. The other, that they induce almen Heathens, or Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of what belief ſoeuer they be, to change opinion, and to ſubmit their iugdments to the obedience of that Religion, for which they are produced.</p>
               <p>This being ſeene, if you pleaſe but to examine a little all thoſe Proteſtants books, which haue been publiſhed in this kind, you ſhall not find any one argument in them, which may be called a generall reaſon, or an vniuerſall motiue for the truth of your Religion: but either they are no leſſe obſcure, then the Religion it ſelfe; as that the word of God is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, and the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred amongſt you: or moſt improbable; as that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants haue beene alwayes the moſt viſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of all other Chriſtian Churches: or that your religion accordeth with the doctrine of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, as here the Biſhop pretendeth: or el; they concerne ſome particuler point in Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and commonly are not only moſt improbable, as that the Maſſe is Idolatry, that the Pope is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and the like; but alſo moſt palbably falſe, as that we hope to be ſaued without the merits of Chriſt, that we worſhip ſtockes and ſtones, that for nication is a veniall ſinne, &amp; ſuch other iniuries
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7997:82"/>of like nature, as it pleaſeth your vnlearned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for want of knowledge, or of better matter, to lay vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other ſide, euery Catholike, whether learned or vnlearned, wiſe or ſimple, is able to giue you ſuch a reaſon of his fayth, as may be ſufficient to moue any indifferent mind, of what belief ſoeuer, to like and imbrace it. For Almighty God, not inforcing man againſt his wil, but draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him according to his Nature, and demaunding a reaſonable obedience of him, hath ordayned in the ſweetnes of his prouidence, that all Chriſtians ſhould make profeſſion of ſome principall motiues of their fayth, wherein many others are vertually conrayned, ſaying in their Creed: <hi>I beleeue the holy Church Catholike:</hi> Not only to moue others therby, but alſo more and more to confirme themſelues in their beliefe. For albeit matter of diuine fayth, be infinitly aboue the knowledge of naturall reaſon, which is not able to comprehend it: yet is it not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto reaſon, but ſo agreable thereunto, that it maketh vs euidently to ſee, and confeſſe how much we are bound in conſcience to imbrace it, and to captiuate our vnderſtanding vnto the obedience of it. And therfore it is further to be conſidered, that the ponderations and inducements which make men Catholiks, are commonly the ſame with thoſe that make men Chriſtians. In which reſpect, as all Chriſtians are bound to know them more or leſſe, according to their capacity: ſo none can re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Wherfore that you may the better conceiue, what difference there is, betweene ſhewes and ſubſtance, truth &amp; errour, light and darknes, hauing examined the Biſhops grounds, publiſhed in fauour of your Religion, I will heere propound, and declare vnto you, ſome generall motiues in the befalfe of our Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing therfore that we will conſider, ſhalbe the holynes, and ſanctity of the Catholike Church, which laying a ſound foundation of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Humility in the harts of her children, &amp; teaching them before all thinges, <hi>to captiuate their vnderſtanding,</hi> and to ſubiect their will, in matters concerning their ſoule, <hi>to their ſpirituall Paſtours,</hi> goeth forward with them, preſcribing them other leſſons; firſt of Contrition, which conſiſteth in the loue of God aboue all things that are to be beloued, and in the hatred of their owne ſinnes, with ſorrow for them aboue all things that are to be hated; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of confeſſion, calling themſelues to a ſtrict accompt for all their ſinnes paſt, in the bitternes of their ſoule, remembring euery ſinne in particuler, &amp; accuſing themſelues intierly of them to their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Father; Thirdly of ſatisfaction, in doing pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their offences againſt the Maieſty of God, in making amends for iniuryes done to others, and in reſtitution of other mens good name, whom they may haue defamed, or goods which they haue wrongfully taken or detayned. By which meanes, hauing reobtayned the fauour, and loue, and grace of God, and thereby being inabled and ſtrengthned

And laſtly, ſuch as wil be perfect, the Catholike faith leadeth further on, and giueth them yet a higher leſſon, teaching them to renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the riches; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the vayne glory of this world, and to offer themſelues vp a perfect Holocauſt, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Almighty God, by conſecrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wholy to his ſeruice; in the ſtate of Chaſtity, voluntary Pouerty, and perpetuall Obedience, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the will of their Superiour.</p>

For conſcience being nothing els, but the light of reaſon, either accuſing, or excuſing our actions, the fountayne of which light, is the image of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, and the very eſſence of our humanity, to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify our ſelues in doing ill, by the externall iuſtice of Chriſt; what is it but to be deliuered ouer into a reprobate ſenſe, ſeeking as <hi>Luther</hi> did, to become ſenſeleſſe of ſin, to put out the light of the ſoule, to murther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, to deface Gods image, &amp; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the very eſſence of our human Nature? And ſin againe, being nothing els, but the conſent of the will, to ſome thing againſt the rule of reaſon, and eſpecially of the reaſon of God, which giueth a rule and a law to all things, and being therfore contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God himſelfe, as it is impoſſible that God ſhould not hate it, or that he ſhould hate any thing but it, being goodnes itſelfe; ſo is it impoſſible, that he ſhould not hate the author, or the doer of it. <hi>God doth equally hate the ſinner, &amp; his ſin: his eyes are cleare that they may not ſee euill,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; they cannot looke fauorably vpon iniquity.</hi> And therfore to abuſe the mercy and goodnes of God ſo much, as to thinke that he may be corrupted to loue vs remayning in ſinne, or not hating the ſame aboue all things to be hated, is one of the greateſt blaſphemies, and iniuries that can be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7997:90"/>done againſt God, and the moſt vnnaturall, ſottiſh, and diabolicall preſumption in our ſelues, that can be thought or deuiſed.</p>
               <p>The difference alſo between the law, and the Ghoſpell, doth yet further diſcouer the monſtrous prophaneſſe of this blaſphemous opinion.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo not being able to obſerue it, our wicked Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taketh occaſion to be more peruerſe, &amp; to hate the law, and to oppoſe it ſelfe againſt it.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I liued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law ſometime</hi> (that is to ſay, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of ſinne, which I receiued by the law) <hi>but when the Commaundment was come, ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided</hi> (it grew ſtronger, &amp; had more force vpon me) <hi>for ſinne</hi> (that is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence of our wicked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>taking occaſion, by the Commaundment, ſeduced me, and by it killed me.</hi> Wherefore the law was ſo far from the iuſtifying of vs, or deliuering vs from the bands of ſyn, that it was an occaſion to increaſe the ſame, and to augment all thoſe other miſeryes, which do follow of it. But by the Ghoſpell, that is to ſay, by fayth in Chriſt, through the merits of his Paſſion, we receiue not only light to know our ſins, but alſo aboundant grace, to auoyd and ouercome them. And therfore, being thus redeemed from the

Wherfore to hold, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath not obtayned ſufficient grace for all thoſe, that ſincerely demaund it, whereby to ouer come ſinne, and to keep the Commaundments of God; what is it, but to confeſſe, that we are ſtill ſubiect to the curſe of the law? What is it, but to make voyd the power of the Ghoſpell to ſaluation? What it is, but to affirme that Chriſt dyed in vaine, and to deny him to be our Redeemer? who not being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vs from the bondage of ſinne in this life, can leſſe deliuer vs from the paynes thereof in the next, becauſe it is impoſſible, but that God in his owne nature ſhould hate it: and therfore it muſt needs be granted, that he will alſo puniſh it as long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth in vs, or we in it; that is to ſay, eternally, according to the Proteſtants doctrine and practiſe, in whoſe Church is no remedy to clenſe vs of deadly ſinnes, committed after Baptiſme, nor to waſh out of our ſoules the malice and filth of ſinne, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning, as it muſt needs with them, being once committed, it is but a poore ſhift to tell vs, that it ſhall not be imputed vnto vs.</p>
               <p>To conclude, what is the Scripture it ſelfe, but a deed of Couenant betweene God and man, for the puniſhment of ſinne, and for the reward of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

               <p>And now that you may the better perceiue with what great reaſon S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt this their pernicious doctrine: Let vs conſider a little I pray you, the conſequence, and effects therof, in many of the greateſt Maiſters, and Apoſtles of the Proteſtant religion. For this made Sebaſtian Caſtalio in his Preface to the great Latin Bible, dedicated to King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. to doubt of thoſe promiſes of God to his Church, ſet downe in Scripture.<note place="margin">See Prot. Apology p. <hi>106.</hi> &amp; ſequent.</note> 
                  <hi>For if any man,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>will affirme, that they haue been performed, I will demaund of him, when? If he ſay, in the Apoſtles tymes; I will demaund how it chaunceth, that neither then the knowledge of God was altogeather perfect: and afterward, how in ſo ſhort a tyme it vaniſhed away, which was promiſſed, that at ſhould be eternall, and more aboundant, then the flouds in the ſea? The more I do peruſe the Scriptures, the leſſe do I find the ſame performed, howſoeuer you vnderstand the foreſayd Propheſies.</hi> And Dauid George, vpon the ſame grounds, came to deny Ieſus our Sauiour to be Chriſt. For if that he had beene the true Chriſt, the Church erected by him, ſhould haue continued for euer. Whereupon alſo he fell to that madnes, that he tooke to himſelfe, the name and office of Chriſt,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7997:101"/>and ſecretly drew many to his opinion; for the which he was taken vp, &amp; burned three yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, by the Proteſtants of Baſil, vnto whom he fled before, being expelled from the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, for holding the opinion of the Sacramentaries againſt the doctrine of Luther, then there profeſſed. His ſtory was written by them of Baſil, about the yeare 1559.</p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Bernardinus Ochinus,</hi> a man ſo renowned amongſt the Proteſtants, as Caluin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, <hi>whom Italy it ſelfe could oppoſe against him?</hi> and Iohn Bale ſayth of him, <hi>That he made England happy with his preſence, and miſerable in his abſence?</hi> This renowned man, as he confeſſeth in the preface of his dialogues, began to wonder, <hi>how it was poſsible, that the Church which was founded by the power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and goodnes of Christ, waſhed with his bloud, and enriched with his ſpirit, ſhould be vtterly ouerthrowne, wherof he ſayth, the Popes were the cauſe:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards began to teach Circumciſion, and wrote a booke of Poligamy, which Beza ſayth, that the afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd <hi>Sebaſtian Castalio</hi> tranſlated out of Italian into Latin, and finally became, as Beza ſayth, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Apoſtata againſt the diuinity of Chriſt. <hi>Alinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a learned Swynglian, for the ſame cauſe, came to be of opinion, that the Meſſias was not yet come, &amp; ſo renouncing Chriſtianity, became a blaſphemous Iew.</p>
               <p>And to omit <hi>Adam Neuſerus</hi> a learned Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſt, chiefe Paſtour at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> who in the end turned Turke, and was circumciſed at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and diuers other Proteſtants, as well of forraine
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7997:102"/>Countreyes, as of our owne Nation, who haue at length denyed the diuinity of Chriſt; Caluin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was greatly ſuſpected therof, in ſo much, as Doctor <hi>Hunnius</hi> publick Profeſſor in the Vniuerſity of Wittemberge, wrote a booke called <hi>Caluinus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizans:</hi> and ſince that tyme, there is another booke publiſhed by a Proteſtant <hi>Lutheran</hi> with this title. <hi>A demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Gods word, that the Caluiniſts are not Chriſtians, but only Baptized Iewes, and Mahomets,</hi> which was alſo reprinted. And of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you may ſee ſufficient matter, in that learned booke of <hi>M. William Reynolds,</hi> intituled <hi>Caluino-Turciſmus:</hi> which euidence alſo, that according to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants opinion God hath fayled of his promiſe, in aduancing and defending his Church according to the Scriptures, muſt needs haue been one chiefe cauſe of thoſe ſwarmes of Athieſts in Proteſtant Countreyes, whereof their principall writers do ſo much complayne.</p>
               <p>Whereat I wonder nothing at all. For to what end did our Sauiour come into the world, but only to eſpouſe his Church in Faith? To what end did he inſtruct her with his preaching, redeeme her with his death and Paſſion, and ſanctify her with his holy Spirit, augment and confirme her with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his Apoſtles, and with the bloud of ſo many millions of Martyrs, but only to make her ſuch a glorious Kingdome, euen vpon earth, according to all the former Propheſies; ſo conſtant, ſo ſtronge, ſo imoueable, that ſhe ſhould vphold the glory of his name, againſt Princes, and Potentats, againſt Kings and Emperours, againſt Schiſmaticks, Heretikes,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7997:102"/>and wicked Chriſtians, and againſt all the force of the world, and on the Diuell himſelfe, that would ſeeke withall his arts, and engines to ſuppreſſe it. Wherefore, if our Sauiour be the true Meſſias, whoſe Name was foretold to be <hi>Deusfortis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Emmanuel,</hi>

               <p>This argument therefore of the largnes, glory, contynuance, viſibility, and inuincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the Church, is of great force to induce any man whatſoeuer, whether he haue the Name, or not ſo much as the Name of a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to become a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.

               <p>VNDER theſe generall tearmes of Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, are compriſed many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler gifts and graces; which being all ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and diuine, ech of them is a ſufficient motiue,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7997:103"/>to perſwade any mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, that the Catholike Church, is the only bleſſed of God, and the elected ſpouſe of Chriſt our Sauiour.

                  </note> was euer conuerted by them.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7997:104"/>a Religion ſo far aboue the reach of Nature, and in reſpect of the auſterity therof, ſo contrary to fleſh &amp; bloud, and eſpecially to their former intemperate liues, and brutiſh cuſtomes, as it ſhewath Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by the Prophets to be dayly fullfilled in them, and proueth our Church thereby to be the Church of Chriſt: So it is moſt euident, that their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſupernaturally aſſiſted by the ſtrength of Gods Arme, which is ſufficient to perſwade any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man, that the doctrine they preach can be no other, then the true Ghoſpell, reuealed by Chriſt to his owne Apoſtles. Which alſo is a manifeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the grounds of Chriſtianity, and of our Catholike doctrine are the very ſame. And that the Proteſtants for want of them, can neuer conuert any Heathen Nation to Chriſtian religion, denying as they do, the grounds therof, which are the ſame with the grounds of the Catholike doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly therefore, many haue ſubmitted themſelues, to the obedience of the Catholike Church by conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe notorious miracles, which in all ages haue beene wrought therin, being ſuch marks of truth, as no man can deny them to be the ſeales of God, and the ſignes of his owne hand. If I ſhould deſcend to particulers in this kind, I ſhould neuer make an end, and many bookes haue beene written of the miracles of the B. Sacrament alone, of our B. Lady in fauour of thoſe, that in their neceſſityes haue recommended themſelues to her prayers, of the ſoules in Purgatory demaunding reliefe of Maſſes, and other pious workes, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thanks for help receiued by thoſe meanes, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7997:104"/>ſo forth, of other miracles, which God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to worke by the hands of his holy ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts aliue and dead, that were pleaſing vnto him; not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from any Apocriphall or vnapproued writers, whom the Proteſtants are wont to deride, but teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied either by the ancient Fathers themſelues, <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, S. Hierome, S. Bernard, S. Bede,</hi> and the reſt, or by the oathes and depoſitions of many lawfull witneſſes, taken before Biſhops, or other ſecular Magiſtrats. Wherunto not to giue ſo much as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall credit, were to extinguiſh one chiefe part of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to take away all credulity, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, all beleife, both human and diuine, out of the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, many haue relented, and rendred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, beholding or reading the admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Catholike Martyrs. For albeit there haue not wanted thoſe, that haue dyed for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of moſt ridiculous hereſyes, and their owne abſurd opinions: yet there is a great difference, both in life, and death, between our Catholike Martyrs, and thoſe other mad men, or malefactors. For as our Martyrs haue for the moſt part beene men of rare perfection, moſt exemplar life, and of excellent talents, both of grace and nature: ſo the others haue beene no leſſe ſcandalous, and infamous for their former lewd conditions, &amp; commonly very meanly qualified, of no extraordinary parts, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, or ſottiſh, or halfe beſides themſelues. And in their deaths, as our Martyrs haue all ſuffred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the inclination of the pride and ſelfe loue of our corrupted nature, in obedience to God, and his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7997:105"/>Church, for the ſame truth, and the ſame poynts of doctrine, without any diſagreement between them, which could not be done without the ſpeciall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods grace: ſo the others haue beene iuſtly puniſhed, for the mantaynance of their own peeuiſh opinions, out of pride, and ſelfe loue, and euer more haue obſtinatly diſſented, not only from the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of others, but alſo from the priuate deuices of one another. And therfore, as the humility, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, meeknes, diſcretion, charity, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of our Martyrs, haue made their paſſions, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to be pleaſing ſacrifices in the eyes, both of God and men, and their deaths moſt amyable, and admyrable to the beholders: ſo on the other ſide, the pride, vaine glory, arrogancy, preſumption, fury, and folly of the others, is ſufficient to make their deaths moſt odious, deteſtable, and infamous to all poſterity. Which, if you pleaſe to read the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Fox his Calendar of Saints, you will eaſily ſee, and ingenuouſly acknowledge this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and difference, which I haue noted, betweene the Martyrdomes of thoſe Catholikes, whom you may haue ſeene to ſuffer in our time, and the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and diſtempered ends of thoſe, which Fox re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth.</p>
               <p>And to omit the innumerable companyes of thoſe, that haue giuen their liues for the teſtimony of the Catholike fayth in former ages, which are at leaſt 1000. for one of thoſe that haue ſuffred for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, and their owne priuate opinions: and likewiſe to omit thoſe excellent men, and women, that haue ſuffered, from the beginning of the laſt Queens rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7997:105"/>vnto this preſent in our infortunate Countrey, whome not only vertue, piety, and wiſdome, but alſo their nobility, dignity, and higheſt Maieſty, haue made famous to the world; what man of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there, that will not be more moued with the death of Bi. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas More</hi> alone, the two great lights of the Clergy &amp; Laity of England, then with al the rabblement of Foxes new Martyrs, though they were ten tymes ſo many, as he doth fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly make them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, many others obſeruing the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Catholiks through the world, to one ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head, and the vnity which thereby is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amongſt them: and on the other ſide, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the infinite diſſentions amongſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, euery man following his owne head, and being the founder of his owne religion; haue beene induced thereby to forſake the troubleſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the one, and imbrace the conſtant peace of the other. For this alſo is ſo euident on both ſides, as the principal Proteſtants themſelues are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſſe it. M.

                  <hi>SECTION XXV.</hi> Of the authority of the Catholike Church in generall.</head>
               <p>THE laſt generall argument, which I intend to propound, for the euidence and truth of the Chriſtian, and, which is al one, of our Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhall be the great authority of the Catholike Church, to the end it may ſerue, as well for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication and confirmation, as alſo for a full concluſion of all the former motiues. For the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7997:107"/>of the beſt vnderſtandings, amongſt vs miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, being but ſmall and ſhallow; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater difference betweene man and man, in the parts of the mynd, then in the ſharpnes of ſenſe, or ſtrength of body; and the mynd of man being of it owne nature but like a fayre table, or a leaſe of white paper, which at the firſt contayneth nothing, and by little and little, receiueth the pictures, or the writings for the which it was ordayned, more or leſſe, better or worſe, according to the skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Paynter, or Writer, and the aptnes of the matter, and the goodnes of the inſtruments wherewith they worke: Hence it is, that as Nature inclineth the poore to depend of the rich, and the weake to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by thoſe that are ſtrong, and the blind, or bad ſighted to be guided and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in diſcerning, by thoſe that are endued with more perfect ſenſe: ſo by the ſame law and voyce of Nature, all men are taught and obliged to reſt their minds, and to rely their vnderſtandings vpon the authority of thoſe that are generally moſt approued for their vertue and wiſdome aboue the reſt; and alwayſe <hi>(ceteris paribus)</hi> other circumſtances being equall, the fewer in number to yeild &amp; ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the iudgment; and opinion of the greater party.</p>
               <p>And ſo in all ſpeculatiue ſciences, where our end is nothing els, but the delightfull aſpect &amp; fayr ſight of truth; the authority of Maiſters, and skillfull men in thoſe facultyes, is neceſſarily required for our direction to teach vs, which way we ought to bend, and whereupon to ſixe the eye of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7997:108"/>to ſhew how to proceed from poynt to poynt, and to giue vs the print of thoſe markes, whereby we may beſt diſcouer the forme of that truth, which we ſeeke to find, or labour to conceiue or comprehend. And if the ſight of our wit be ſo ſhort, as that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not perfectly diſcerne the ſame, yet it is better to ſee with another mans eye, or as it were by the candle of another, then altogeather ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ignorant of it, or els, which is far worſe, to be deceiued therein. And as this is true in ſcience: ſo in thoſe arts and facultyes, where our end is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or the attayning of ſomething which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or profitable for mans life, the benefit of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is much more apparent. For in extremity of ſicknes, or in law matters of great importance, or in deliberations about the preſeruation or gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Commonwealths, to contemne the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Phiſitians, the aduice of Lawyers, and the counſell of men experienced in matter of State, or not to admit therof in ſome caſes, nor to ſuffer our ſelues to be oueruled thereby; albeit it ſeeme neuer ſo much contrary to the ſenſe, or imagination of our owne priuate iudgment, were to be eſteemed rather obſtinate madnes, then any other errour within the degree of human weaknes.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially the neceſſity and vtility of the approbation of other mens aſſertions, either of all, or of ſuch as are wiſe and honeſt, appeareth in thoſe things which we can neuer know, or make vſe of, but from the report of others. As for example hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoryes of former ages, Relations of the preſent ſtate, and condition of forrayne Countreys; or conſtant
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7997:108"/>reports of ſuch things, as were ſayd or done in our abſence; or as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> noteth, that we are the ſonnes of ſuch Parents, borne in this Countrey or that (which is the beginning and foundation of all permanent ſocietyes) and the like. In which reſpect this kind of knowledge, is properly called beliefe, becauſe our iudgment giueth conſent thereunto, not being moued, by any inward experimentall light of our owne reaſon: but only by giuing credit vnto others; which, as you ſee, being as it were not only the other hand or Canonicall eye of reaſon, but alſo the Schole-maiſter thereunto, is of ſuch neceſſity, that neither the ſtate of Church and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Wealth, nor the life of man can ſtand without it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as in all queſtions and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſyes it is a generall rule and a receiued <hi>Maxime,</hi> that the iudgment of all men, or of the moſt, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt of the beſt and wyſeſt, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be followed: ſo eſpecially, it muſt needs haue place in the Schoole of Chriſt; the Learning whereof, being as it is, not only one kind of belief, and therefore wholy depending of authority: but alſo ſuch a practicall ſcience, as concerneth a matter of no leſſe moment, then our eternall felicity, and endleſſe miſery. And conſequently, if wiſedome will that in ſicknes we ſhould follow the directions of all Phiſitians, or of the moſt, and beſt learned, reiecting ſuch deſperate medicynes, as a few vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Empericks, or Quackſaluers (as they tearme them) ſhould propound vnto vs. Or as in matter of law, or State buſines of great conſequence, all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon commandeth vs to preferre the iudgment of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7997:109"/>moſt auncient Sages, and graueſt Counſellours, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being many in number, before the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a few Pettyfoggers, or yong ambitious heads that aſpyre to be Politicks: ſo in the caſe of the eternall damnation, or ſaluation of our ſoules, it ſtands vs more vpon, moſt exactly to obſerue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principle, as well in relying our ſelues vpon the doctrine and authority of the moſt, the beſt, and the wiſeſt Deuines, as in flying the new deuices of a few diſorderly, factious, and infamous vpſtarts, that ſeeke to with draw vs from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, that the truth of Catholike Religion is recommended vnto vs by the teſtimony of the moſt, is euident in it ſelfe. The Catholike Church poſſeſſing ſo many Countreyes, not only in Europe, but alſo in Aſia, Africa, and America, both Eaſt and Weſt, as the Proteſtants themſelues auouch; and there being no other Sect of Religion wherein ſo many do ſo conſtantly agree togeather, not only the Pagans and Infidells, as is notoriouſly knowne, but alſo the Heretikes being infinitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyded among themſelues, as I haue ſhewed. And that, if you reſpect honeſty, vertue, and good life, the Catholikes are alſo the beſt, is likewiſe confeſſed by their enemyes themſelues, as hath been declared; and ſetting all other conſiderations apart, there being ſo many Orders and great Religious bodyes among them, following the Counſells of Chriſt, in renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the riches, the pleaſures, and the pryde and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the world, which are the only occaſions of ſinne, ſubmitting themſelues to the direction of thoſe, who by long practiſe, and tradition, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7997:109"/>prayer, and their owne exact obedience, haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how to commaund with ſweetnes, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Ghoſtly children from their ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and how to conduct them to the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all Chriſtian vertues; in which courſe of ſpirituall life, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayth very notably, <hi>he that willbe his owne Maiſter, ſhall haue a foole to his Scholler:</hi> &amp; to conclude, their whole life being ſpent in nothing els, but in aſſiſting the Sacrifice of the Church, in hearing and reading the word of God, in pryuate and publike prayer, in mortification of their ſenſes and naturall deſires, and in other deuout exerciſes of religious obedience, of which ſort alone, there being many hundred thouſands in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, beſides other innumerable ſecular people that imitate the liues of Religious perſons; it muſt needs be granted, that in all human reaſon, ſo great a number of the like deuout and holy people, conſecrated to the pure ſeruice of God, cannot be found by the hundreth part in all the reſt of the world that is not Catholike, being put togeather.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that the Catholikes excell (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſpeaking of the Clergy) the reſt of the world in all kind of learning, knowledge and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, both human and diuine, may ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the meanes they haue to attaine thereunto before others, &amp; by the effects therof in their workes and writings. For firſt, as concerning the meanes and helps, which God hath prouided for them to arriue to the perfection of knowledge, as all the world in reſpect of Chriſtendome, is nothing els, but barbariſme: ſo amongſt thoſe, that beare the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7997:110"/>name of Chriſtians, if any Countreyes excell the reſt, in quicknes of wit, maturity of iudgment, and capacity of great vnderſtanding; they are thoſe that ſtill remayne vntaynted, and vntouched from the Schiſmes, and Hereſies of this preſent tyme. And beſides this knowne aduantage of naturall tallents, the manner, and conſtant courſe of ſtudy amongſt them is ſuch, as that to ſpeake, for examples ſake, of the Ieſuites alone, doubtles a meane vnderſtanding may ſooner attayne, to be an excellent learned man by their education, then an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wit, may come to any mediocrity by the ſlacke &amp; diſorderly courſe of teaching, which is held in England, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countrey that is not Catholike. Which <hi>Syr Francis Bacon</hi> in one of his bookes doth acknowledg in great part, and your ſelfe will eaſily beleeue by their manner of ſtudy in Philoſophy and Deuinity alone, which heer I will briefly ſet downe vnto you.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, all their Schollers in theſe ſciences, do write for an houre in the forenone, and another houre after dinner, two ſeuerall Lectures, which their Maiſters do dictate vnto them, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wordes ſo leaſurely, that they need not looſe one word of their Maiſters readings. In this manner, they continue in hearing their Philoſophy 3. yeares togeather, vnder one &amp; the ſame Maiſter. The firſt yeare, is appropriated to Logicke, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to Phiſickes, and the third to the Metaphiſicks of Ariſtotle. In which manner, all the queſtions of moment, &amp; profit, as they depend of one another: ſo likewiſe they are methodically, &amp; orderly deliuered vnto them, togeather with the explication of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7997:110"/>Text, and meaning of Ariſtotle where it importeth. The Lecture being ended, and they being deuyded into many claſſes, vnder ſo many ſeuerall repetitors or moderators, appointed to heare them, they repeat for halfe an houre their precedent leſſons, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vpon them one againſt the other in the Schoole before they departe, their Maiſter being preſent. And afterward, they returne to make the like repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and diſputations for an houre togeather, more exactly then before, at a certaine tyme prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed euery day, in their ſeuerall Colledges, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademyes, and other places of priuate meetings: which tyme being put togeather maketh 4. houres. The reſt of the day is imployed in ſtudy and prayer; ſauing that in the yeare of Phiſickes, they beſtow halfe an houre euery day vpon Mathematickes, and in the yeare of Metaphiſickes vpon morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which is read vnto them by other Maiſters. As euery day they dispute of the Lectures giuen them the dayes before, ſo alſo euery weeke, they haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the matter giuen them in that weeke. And euery moneth, as the 3. Maiſters of Logicke, Phiſicke, and Metaphiſicke can agree, they meete togeather in the ſame Schoole, withall their Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and diſpute one againſt another in the matters of that moneth, wherunto, as being more publique, other Maiſters and Doctors are inuited. And beſides all this, they haue other priuate exerciſes, and helps of learning in their particuler Colledges. At the end of the yeare ſuch as haue ſtudyed beſt, are preferred to defend Concluſions publique of the whole yeare, and they that haue heard their courſe of three years,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7997:111"/>and are the moſt worthy of all their fellows, defend concluſions of all Philoſophy, with great ſolemnity and concourſe of people. Which courſe of ſtudy breedeth ſuch emulation among them, and draweth them on with ſuch delight of their owne profit, that their Superiours haue more ado, to keep them from ſtudying too much, then els where Maiſters are wont to haue, in keeping their ſchollers from doing nothing.</p>
               <p>Their courſe of Diuinity laſteth foure years. The manner of their Lectures &amp; diſputations is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame with the former of the Philoſophers; ſauing that they haue three ſeuerall Maiſters, who read euery day in ſeuerall matters, and explicate the moſt difficult places of the Scripture and Fathers, as their former Maiſter did expound Ariſtotle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers. And inſteed of Mathematikes &amp; morall Philoſophy, they haue other Lectures of Tongues, &amp; of the Text of Scripture. Beſides Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and Diuinity, for ſuch as haue leſſe tyme, or leſſe ſtrength of mynd or body, there are two other Lectures euery day of Poſitiue Diuinity, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is called Caſes of Conſcience: a ſtudy as litle knowne to Proteſtants, as there is little care, or vſe of Conſcience amongſt them. Their courſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Diuinity being thus ended, ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ieſuits themſelues, as are thought to be moſt fit for Schooles, are permitted for two yeares to go ouer the whole body of their ſtudyes agayne, by their owne priuate induſtry, conferring the ſame with the doctrine and opinions of other writers, &amp; afterward they are appoynted and made Maiſters to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7997:111"/>read Philoſophy, and with tyme Diuinity, if their ſtrength and talents do ſo deſerue. By this meanes you ſee that almoſt of neceſſity they muſt haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maiſters, and excellent ſchollers, &amp; the one is a great help, and a great encouragment to perfect the other.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this that hath beene ſayd of their courſe of ſtudy, it is of great moment to conſider. that all the Maiſters, and the greateſt part of their ſchollers, are Religious men, or liue religiouſly, in Seminaryes and Colledges, where being freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all kind of worldly care, and occaſion of paſſion, diſorder or temptation, hauing their ſet tymes for prayer, and honeſt recreation, and ſuch as be Prieſts offering dayly ſacrifice to Almighty God, and ſuch as are none, confeſſing and communicating once a weeke at the leaſt, they enioy that quietnes of mind &amp; ſweet peace of conſcience, which togeather with Gods benediction is moſt fit for ſcience. And thus they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, not only for a while, as elswher ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are wont to do, vntill they marry, or get prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but al their lines long, without any ſecular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, or deniation whatſoeuer. And that which I haue ſayd of the Ieſuites, may be alſo affirmed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholy, or in great part, of many other ſecular Doctours, and almoſt of all Religious Orders, the <hi>Dominicans, Franciſcant, Auguſtines, Carmelits, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins, Bernardines,</hi> and the reſt, who for euery houre, which your ſchollers or Miniſters do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpend in ſtudy, or prayer, they that ſtudy &amp; pray leaſt, ſpend 2. at the leaſt one with the other, eſpecially conſidering the conſtancy &amp; continuance
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7997:112"/>of ours, in theſe exerciſus for all their liues, and the great inconſtancy and diſcontinuance of yours, which is notorious. And therfore if the grounds of all kind of learning being ſoundly layd, &amp; conſtant prayer; and good life, and the ſtudy of Scripture be the fitteſt meanes to find out the truth of Religion, and to obtaine true wiſedome at the hands of God: It cannot be denyed, but that the poſſeſſion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection therof muſt rather be found in the Catholike Clergy, then among the Miniſtord of any other ſect of Religion in the world.</p>
               <p>Whereof our Catholike Deuynes in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age haue alſo made euident demonſtration by their workes and wrytings, For whether you reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact their erudition in the ſacred Tongnes, their explications of all arts and ſcyences, and eſpecially their readings vpon all queſtions of Diuinity, their commentaryes vpon all the parts of Scripture, their treatiſes, as well of deuntion, piety, and perfection of Chriſtian life, with the meanes to attayne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as alſo of prayer, both vocall and mentall, which is againe deuided into meditation, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall contemplation (of which later parts, the Proteſtants haue neither the practiſe nor ſcarce vnderſtand the meaning) the number and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of thoſe bookes which the Catholikes haue publiſhed in this age of ours, is ſo great, and ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no former ages of the world, for aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and perfection of Scyence put togeather, may be compared with it. Wheras if you will reflect a little; and iudge indifferently, you ſhall ſcarce find three bookes publiſhed by the Proteſtants (vnleſſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7997:112"/>you will except thoſe of Poetry printed in vulgar languages, and in reſpect of the matter are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be excepted) which are not already contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Proteſtants themſelues, and are therfore no way likely to remayne vnto poſterity.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue ſhewed the authority of the Catholike profeſſours for the truth of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whether you reſpect their number, or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or learning, or perfection of life, to be ſuch as doth moſt euidently, and notoriouſly exceed the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of any other Church, or Congregation whatſoeuer. Vnto which authority of the ſecular Clergy, and Layty, and of all the ſeuerall Orders and Religious bodyes of the Catholike Church at this tyme; if you ioyne the authorityes of all the holy and ancient Fathers, whoſe naturall tallents, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall gifts of learning, ſanctity &amp; wiſedome, are aboue all compariſon: And if vnto theſe againe, you ioyne the authorityes of ſo many general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, as haue been receaued by the vniuerſal Church, wherein ſo many tymes all the learning and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the whole world haue met togeather: And laſtly vnto all this if you adde the teſtimonyes of all Chriſtians for a 1000. yeares togeather, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelues confeſſe, and of all the former ages, euen from the tyme of Chriſt, as we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Fathers of thoſe times, vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning the opinions of the Proteſtants, and being mutually condemued by them; they come to be ſo many worlds of witneſſes, as there hath been ages ſince the tyme of Chriſt, and viſibly make vp that great Mountayne of authority, which filleth the world
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7997:113"/>and which all thoſe that will not aſcend to know the truth muſt needs be cruſhed by it, if they reſiſt it, and eternally periſh vnder it, if they contemne it.</p>
               <p>This is that great benefit which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke <hi>de vtilitate Credends,</hi> acknowledgeth, that the world in theſe latter tymes, hath receiued of Almighty God, who of his infinit goodnes hath prouided, that the Catholike Faith, being ſo auſtere to the eye of fleſh and bloud, ſo much aboue reaſon, and ſo contrary as it is, to our corrupted nature, ſhould be recommended vnto vs, as it were, by the generall conſent, and common beliefe of all people. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith S. Auguſtine) <hi>the diuine prouydence hath brought to paſſe by the predictions of the Prophets, by the humanity and doctrine of Chriſt, by the trauells of the Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de vtil. Cred. cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>by the contumelyes, croſſes, bloud, and death of Martyrs, by the laudable life of Saints; and in all theſe things, by ſuch myracles, as were fit for matters, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſo great as theſe, according as the oportunity of times required. Wherefore, ſeing the aſsiſtance of God to be ſo great, and ſo great the fruite and benefit thereof; ſhall we doubt to caſt our ſelues, into the lap of his Church? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering (that now) euen by the confeſsion of mankind it ſelfe, ſhe hath receaued the prohemynence of all authority, from the Apoſtolike ſeat by ſucceſsion of Biſhops: the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes in the meane tyme, hauing barked about her all in vayne, &amp; partly by the iudgment of the people themſelues, partly by the grauity of Councells, and partly by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of miracles, hauing been all condemned. To which Church not to grant the highest degree of authority, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreme impiety, or precipitate arrogancy. For if our, ſoules haue no certayne way to attayne true wiſedome
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7997:113"/>and ſaluation, but where fayth &amp; beliefe prepareth, and adorneth our reaſon: what is it els to reſiſt authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued or eſt abbſhed with ſo great labour, but to be vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to this help and aſsiſtance of Almighty God?</hi>

               <p>Thus far S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> of the notable benefit that our faith hath receiued from the Common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſo many Nations therein, which he calleth the confeſſion of mankind, and of the wonderfull meanes which God hath vſed for the procurement of this vniuerſall teſtimony, vnto the truth thereof. For albeit, when the Apoſtles began firſt to preach, all rules and principles of humayne wiſedome were inforced to giue place vnto that diuine authority wherewith they were ſent, to their gifts of Tongues to the myracles they wrought, to the power of that ſpirit which ſpake by them, and to the ſplendour of thoſe celeſtiall vertues, which proceded from them: yet ſince that time, the ſweetnes of Gods prouidence hath ſo ordayned, that both theſe authorityes Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and Diuine, the wiſedome of God, and the wiſedome that naturally directeth worldly men, ſhould be ioyned togeather; to the end, that all mens wills might be drawne more eaſily, gently, and connaturally, to imbrace the doctrine of Chriſt; And that all vnderſtandings, great or ſmall, might either be conuinced, or conuicted by it.</p>
               <p>The voice of the moſt, the teſtimony of thoſe that are true and honeſt, and the iudgment, example, and practiſe of the wiſeſt, being the beſt part of that light of nature which God hath lent vs for the direction of our liues; his infinit goodnes, and perfect iuſtice, could neuer haue permitted this

                  </gap> to this vnmeaſurable greatnes, nor could haue made it ſo inuincibly victorious againſt all thoſe that haue oppoſed themſelues vnto it: confirming the ſame with ſo many Propheſies of Scripture, and promiſes of his owne, and not only with the oſtenſion of miracles, and heroycall conſtancy of innumerable Martyrs; but alſo with the glory and ſplendour of ſo many other benedictions of excellent learning, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wiſedome, admirable vnity, piety, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of vertue, as hath been ſhewed; vnleſſe it had been ſo ordayned by him, for the recommendation, and preſeruation of that Truth which himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from heauen to teach the world, and to dye the death of the Croſſe, for the eternall memory, and fructification of it. For if in any thing we ſhould be deceiued by the power and greatnes of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we might well ſay, it was no fault of ours, but rather, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmeth, it were either <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme impiety, or precipitate arrogancy.</hi> Not to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, what need there any other reuelations, or miracles, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> alſo obſerueth, in a caſe ſo cleere as this? If ſo many Nations haue been conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the obedience of this ſupernaturall faith, and for ſo many ages haue been preſerued in vnity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, without ſignes and miracles; this it ſelfe is a moſt ſufficient, apparent, and perpetuall miracle for the teſtimony of the truth thereof.</p>

               <p>AS the obiect of reaſon doth farre exceed the knowledge of our ſenſes: ſo the truth of things ſupernaturall and diuine, do no leſſe ſurmount the light of reaſon. And therfore, the end of man, and the meanes to attaine vnto it, being both of them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall &amp; diuine; as it was neceſſary that God ſhould reueale, and deliuer the knowledge thereof to his Prophets and Apoſtles, obliging all men to beleeue them: ſo it was alſo expedient, that there ſhould be ſome certayne meanes ordained and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Almighty God, wherby we might infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know what it was, that was ſo reuealed vnto them. For otherwiſe if there be not ſuch ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and certaine help to attaine the knowledge of thoſe Diuine Miſteryes, which do ſo much exceed the power and faculty of human vnderſtanding; to perſwade our ſelues that we ſhall be able to arriue to any certaine knowledge of them by any human di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or naturall endeauour alone, were as wiſe a matter, as for a man to go about to read in the darke, or for him that hath no eyes to iudge of colours. Nay, it were much more ridiculous: For ſuch a kind of darke reading, or blind iudgment might be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed or aduentured for ſome little wager, or to make men paſtyme: but Chriſtians that make their beliefe the rule of their life and death, laying not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7997:115"/>only their fortunes, but alſo their ſoules vpon it, vnles they haue ſome Diuine help, and infallible aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God, to know thoſe things which they beleeue to haue beene reuealed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and can no way be diſcerned by human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; they can neuer be excuſed from meer madnes, and ridiculous folly.</p>
               <p>Vpon what grounds the Catholiks beleeue the doctrine and preaching of the Apoſtles, which is the Ghoſpell, and the obiect of their fayth to haue beene reuealed from the mouth of God, and that the Church is perpetually &amp; infallibly aſſiſted by God himſelf, in the preſeruation of the foreſayd doctrine from all ſtayne, or touch of errours, hath beene ſhewed already: Almighty God hauing ſo magnified and fortifyed the authority of his Church, as if the will of man be not too much peruerted, it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible for his vnderſtanding to reſiſt it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayd notably:<note place="margin">Cont. epiſt. Fundam.</note> 
                  <hi>That be would not beleeue the Ghoſpell, except the authority of the Catholike Church did mooue him thereunto:</hi> ſo alſo he ſayth as plainly,<note place="margin">Auguſt. epiſt. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> that it was <hi>moſt inſolent pride,</hi> to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, the mind of man being inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable of knowledge, for which it was created, and according to the Philoſopher, it being better to know a little of Diuine thinges, then to haue great intelligence of other matters: hence it followeth, that to know ſo many celeſtiall Miſteryes, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt containeth, in ſo ſhort a tyme, with ſuch great eaſe, and infallible certainty, being grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon ſo many conuincing arguments and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7997:115"/>teſtimonyes of Diuine authority; which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being alſo that pretious ſtone, that bringeth with it all good thinges, and beginneth that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynes in this life, which is perfected, and rewarded with eternall felicity in the next: This I ſay, muſt needs be a wonderfull ſtrong and excellent motiue to compell all thoſe to enter into the Schoole and Church of Chriſt, whoſe mynds haue any dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer their bodyes, and are not wholy tranſported with the pride of life, or altogeather drowned in worldly deſires, or brutiſh ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Proteſtants on the other ſide, profeſſing to haue no other ground of Fayth, but only the bare Scripture, do ſhew therein, that they haue neither ſufficient ground to beleeue that God hath reuealed his ſecrets to the world, nor any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino aſſiſtance to know, and diſcerne what ſeerets they are that were ſo reuealed. For firſt as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Scripture, denying the authority of the Church as they do, if <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> for example, ſhould deny the Scripture, which he ſayth plainely, <hi>that he would not beleeue, vnloſſe the authority of the Church did moue him thereunto;</hi> how I pray you, could they perſwade <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> by Scripture alone, which he would flatly deny, that any thing was euer reuealed by God? or being reuealed, that it was truely deliuered againe? or that any part of thoſe thinges, which were reuealed, was writen by the ſpirit of God, and ſo recommended to poſterity? Secondly, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe making mention of many other bookes of Scripture, that are not extant, though one ſhould graunt, that ſome part of Gods word was written,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7997:116"/>which the Proteſtants without cauſe beleeue, how could they proue, that any part therof remayneth? For if ſome bookes are loſt, why may not all haue periſhed? Thirdly, the malice of the Iewes, and the fraud of Heretikes being ſo great as they are, and the diligence of Scribes in writing being no more but humane, and the copyes of Scripture being very many, and very different one from another: and the Hebrew Text, hauing beene written a long tyme without vowells, and the adding or giuing of diuers vowells, making diuers and contrary ſenſes, &amp; the vowells themſelues being but little prickes ſet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the letters, and the Characters being ſo ſtrange, and many of them ſo like one another as they are, and therefore, it being not only an eaſy matter to change them, but alſo it ſeeming almoſt impoſſible that they ſhould not haue beene miſtaken among ſo many writers, in ſo many ſeuerall Countreyes, for ſo many yeares togeather; all this conſidered, though a man ſhould graunt, that ſome bookes of Scripture were not loſt: how I beſeech you, can the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſhew, that any part thereof is free from errour and foule corruption, eſpecially granting as they do, that many places of the Originalls are actually corrupted?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſuppoſing the originalls, either to haue remayned perfect all this while, or els to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by them to their perfection, whereof they can haue no other ground, but their owne wilfull imagination; conſidering that all their interpreters haue tranſlated with paſſion and preiudice in fauour of their owne opinions, and in oppoſition to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7997:116"/>Roman Church, and to the auncient vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation; following therein,<note place="margin">See the Proteſtant Apol. p. <hi>256. 257. 258.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, giuing vnto them, that ſome things haue been reuealed by God, and were truly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and truly written: and that ſome of thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings haue been preſerued by God, and ſtill remaine, miraculouſly vncorrupted: And that the Caluiniſts alone, or the Proteſtants of England alone, haue only the true verſion, or tranſlation therof; the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Diony. de Eccleſ. hierar. c. <hi>1.</hi> Orig. in prin. peria. &amp; tract. <hi>23.</hi> in Mat.

Eſpecially conſidering that contrary to their owne ground, they pretend to belieue many things which indeed are true, but no where expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the Scripture: as that the Scripture it ſelfe is the word of God: that children may be baptized before they belieue: That Baptiſme in roſe water,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7997:117"/>or any liquour, then naturall Elementary water, or in the Name of Chriſt alone, is not good and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. That the Baptiſme of Turkes, and Iewes, and Heretikes, is good in ſome caſes. That it is allwayes a ſinne to rebaptize. That God the Father hath no Father, which among many others is one inſtance of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> againſt the Heretikes of his tyme, acknowledging no other ground of their Fayth, but only Scripture. That the Sabaoth day which is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, ought not to be publickly obſerued as holy, which is againſt the Commaundement of the Law: and that all Chriſtians are obliged to obſerue the Sunday, whereof there is not commaundement to be found in the written word of the Ghoſpell. That our Bleſſed Lady remayned, and continued ſtill a Virgin. That Eaſter day ought to be kept vpon a Sunday. That it is lawfull to eat bloud, and ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led meats, contrary to the words of the Decree of the Church, in the Acts of Apoſtles, and the like. Many things alſo they belieue, that are meerly fals, and not only not contayned in the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but alſo expreſly contrary thereunto.

                  </note> inuiſible; that it hath erred, and that many true Prophets or preachers haue been ſent to reforme it: whereas the Scripture only tells of falſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7997:117"/>Prophets to come, and ſaith expreſſy, <hi>that the gates of hell ſhall not preuayle against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, if you will but barre the Proteſtants their owne expoſitions and argumentations vpon the Scripture, which they confeſſe themſelues to be no part of the written word, they cannot produce ſo much as one expreſſe place of Scripture for any of thoſe opinions, ſo peremptorily defended, and ſtifly obiected againſt vs: which me thinkes, conſidering how much they vaunt of Scripture, is ſufficient of it ſelfe. to make ſuch as are good amongſt them aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their errours; and ſheweth moſt euidently, that the firſt authours of this new Ghoſpell, haue founded the ſame vpon nothing els, but only vpon their owne impudency, the malice of the tyme, and the weaknes of their hearers. By all which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it is more then manifeſt, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants denying the authority of the Church, they ouerthrow the authority of the Scripture: and that refuſing to receiue the ſame from the Church, they haue no Scripture at all, but that diuers wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting their owne grounds, inſteed of Scripture they miſerably abuſe themſelues, with their owne tranſlations, and their owne imaginations, and haue nothing els, but only the bare name, and outward ſhew of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And now to come to the ſecond Stone of their foundation which is the point of their pryuate ſpirit Firſt, they can produce no place of Scripture, to proue either that the Scripture alone is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ruie of Faith or that God hath promiſed his holy ſpirit to euery particuler man, in expounding the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7997:118"/>Scripture. And therefore belieuing either the one or the other, they ouerthrow their owne grounds, and belieue ſomething more then Scripture, which is not expreſly contayned therein. Secondly, this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of interpreting the Scripture, according to the priuate ſpirit of euery particuler man, is not only warranted by the Scripture, but alſo expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto. For the Scripture commaundeth vs, for the deciding of controuerſyes about the ſame, to <hi>aſcend to the high Prieſt for the tyme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 17.9.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and to obay him vpon payne of death: to require the Law from the lips of the Prieſts: to heare the Church:</hi> and, <hi>that ſuch as will not heare it, ſhalbe accompted as Heathens, and Infidells: to do as they ſay who ſhall ſit in the Chayre of Moyſes,</hi> and the like. Which places are contrary to that infallible aſſiſtance of euery mans priuate ſpirit, which the Proteſtants pretend, and are further confirmed by the practiſe, and execution of them, in the primitiue Church, recorded alſo by the Scripture. For all the Apoſtles were not commaunded to write, but to <hi>preach,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15.</note> and the world was obliged, not to belieue any particuler ſpirit, but the <hi>words and writings</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from the ſpirit of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">

And therfore as the Church was founded not only by Scripture, but alſo by the vnwritten word of God: ſo alſo it muſt be preſerued. And as the world at that tyme belieued the words and wrytings of the Apoſtles, deliuered by themſelues: ſo now it muſt giue credit therunto, being likewiſe deliuered
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7997:118"/>by their Succeſſors. <hi>We haue a more firme Propheticall ſpeach, whereunto you do well to attend</hi> (ſayth S.

                  <hi>the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Schiſm might be taken away.</hi> But of this we haue ſpoken ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently els where, and haue alſo ſhewed by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Proteſtants for want of this publike authority, are infinitly deuided among themſelues, and cenſure moſt terribly, and condemne moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremly the ſeuerall opinions of one another.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to proceed, and to omit for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uityes ſake, that this rule of priuate interpretation being once admitted, there would follow nothing els, but an infinite confuſion of little truth, &amp; much falſehood in the Church of God: And that the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof ſhould haue no meanes to diſcerne with whome they ought to hold communion, as ſincere and orthodoxall, nor whome to auoyd, as corrupt and hereticall. What can be more contrary to the light of Nature, then where all haue equall meanes to know the truth, or that ſome for ſundry good reſpects may be thought to excell the reſt, euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler man, though neuer ſo ſimple, ſhould more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in his owne priuate vnderſtanding, then in the iudgment of the beſt and wiſeſt? which as it is moſt abſurd in all kind of knowledge: ſo eſpecially in the right vnderſtanding &amp; interpretation of Scripture, being in great part moſt obſcure, and euery where ſubiect to errour, as you may eaſily iudge by the controuerſyes, decrees, and generall Councells of the Church concerning the ſame; by the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of ſo many excellent wits, &amp; learned men, that haue erred therein; and by the explications, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaryes, that without end are made
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7997:120"/>vpon them. And truely that euery Proteſtant, man, woman, and child. plough-man, artificer, or of what profeſſion ſoeuer, learned or vnlearned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can read or no, ſhould take it vpon them, and vpon their ſaluation, as they do, and as they are bound to do, according to the ground of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to iudge infallibly by the Scripture alone, which bookes are Scripture, and which not; and to know euery verſe, and euery line of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, from that which is not Canonicall, better then the ancient Fathers, or <hi>Laodicean</hi> Councell for example, who doubted of many of them, and better then that famous Councell of Carthage, where at S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was preſent, &amp; is thought to haue been the Secretary and penner of it, which decreed many bookes to be Scripture that are now contradicted &amp; reiected by the Proteſtants; is ſo ſtrange a madnes, as it ſeemeth impoſſible, that it ſhould ſinke into any mans hart to imagine, or that the mind of any ſober man could be deluded with it.</p>
               <p>And the ſame we may ſay of the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture. For beleeuing as an article of their Fayth, that there is no external means, wherby they may infallibly know the meaning of Scripture, but by the Scripture; euery idle companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preferreth his owne priuate iudgment therin, not only before the iudgment of all the Fathers in particuler, who haue doubted of many poynts of Fayth, and of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of many places in Scripture, vntill by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell their doubts were cleared; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſentence of the vniuerſall Church, which euery Proteſtant doth imagine to haue groſly erred,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7997:120"/>beleeuing in the meane tyme his owne opinion to be moſt infallible. Which is yet more ſtrang, in that the Proteſtants perſwading themſelues to be moſt certaine, that they haue the Scripture, and the true interpretation of Scripture, they confeſſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the meanes which they vſe for the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this certainty, to be moſt vncertayne: That is to ſay, the reading of Scripture, their conference of places, their diligence, prayer, and the like.</p>
               <p>Whereof the two laſt alone are common to all, and euery one of theſe meanes being by their owne confeſſion but human endeauours, are therefore ſubiect to the errour of our frayle Nature, &amp; to the common ouerſight of mans infirmity. And as all partyes among them condemne ech other: ſo there was neuer any Proteſtant in the world, whom they beleeue or acknowledge, notwithſtanding the vſe of all theſe meanes, not to haue been very much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the interpretation of the Scripture. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the authority of the Catholicke Church, in reſpect of the clarity and extenſion therof is fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> to be that <hi>Lightning</hi> of the comming of Chriſt, which breaking forth out of heauen, <hi>is ſcene from the Eaſt to the Weſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.27.</note> and filleth the world, inforcing all men to behold it: ſo it is no great myſtery to vnderſtand, that the Proteſtants ſhutting their eyes againſt it, haue choſen to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſuch a ground of their fayth, as by it ſelf alone is not only moſt vncertaine vnto them, for diuers &amp; ſundry cauſes; but alſo in reſpect of the formality therof is moſt contrary to Scripture, moſt oppoſite to reaſon, and moſt euidently ouerthrowing it ſelfe,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7997:121"/>as hath beene ſhewed. Whereof becauſe no man, that is not willfully blind among you, can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, therfore I can blame none of thoſe great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, of whome your authors do ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, who preferre the light of ſenſe, or naturall reaſon, before the fayth of the Proteſtants, and chuſe rather to beleeue nothing, then to be ſo grosſly, and ſo manifeſtly deceiued. For ſuch a kind fayth, as hath been ſhewed, doth not perfect the light of naturall reaſon, but abuſe it, nor maketh men ſpiritually wiſe but rather diabolically contentious, and abſurdly fooliſh. And the ground therof being falſe and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous, they who rely the moſt thereupon, are the moſt deceiued.</p>
               <p>And albeit they may hold many things that are true, yet ſpeaking properly of diuine faith, they haue no faith at all, whereof I gaue you the reaſon, in the beginning of this Section: becauſe to ayme at the ſecrets of God, or to mooue any diſpute about them, without ſome infallible meanes, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ordayned for the preſeruation, tradition and preaching, or deliuery of them, is no leſſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, then for blind men, as I haue ſayd, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend of colours; or as S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, no better then <hi>vayne and idle talking;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.7.</note> 
                  <hi>not vnderſtanding, neither what is ſpoken, nor of what to affirme.</hi> But as the Turkes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are perſwaded that there is one God, yet receiuing it from their Alcaron which is the ground of their fayth, and teacheth them many vntruths; their perſwaſion of the vnity of God, is no beliefe, but errour. Or as the Iewes, albeit they receiue the old Teſtament as you know: yet becauſe they rely
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7997:121"/>vpon the interpretation of their Rabbins, which is ſubiect to errour, their ground being deceitfull; their faith is nothing but deceipt, and therefore no faith at all. So in like manner the Proteſtants, albeit they follow a rule, which according as they vſe it, doth propound vnto them many things that are true: yet propounding likewiſe very many that are falſe, and being thereby deceitfull, as hath been declared, they belieue the truth, it ſheweth no more then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the falſhood, whereof it is manifeſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue nothing at all. And for this cauſe the authority of the Church being the only ordinary meanes to make vs know the rule of faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17.</note> our Sauiour himſelf ſayd, that <hi>ſuch as would not heare the Church, were no better then Infidells;</hi> becauſe conſequently depryuing themſelues of the rule of Faith, they looſe all true Faith, and diuine fidelity. From whence likewiſe is inferred that common principle of Chriſtendome, <hi>that out of the Church there is no ſaluation:</hi> becauſe without Faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and without obedience to the Church in matter of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, there can be no faith at all. From hence alſo the Councell of <hi>Nyce,</hi> as witneſſeth the <hi>Creed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> read in your Churches euery Sunday, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the auncient Fathers, hath concluded; that <hi>denying one article of the Catholike Faith, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the ſame wholy, and inuiolably,</hi> no man can be ſaued. Becauſe he that obſtinatly denyeth, or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of any one poynt of Faith, denieth the authority of the Church, without which we cannot certainly know the rule of Faith, &amp; therby looſing his faith, is no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Infidel, as our Sauiour hath declared.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION XXVII.</hi> VVherein two Motiues, that is to ſay, Feare of danger, and the Inſtigation of a certayne ſpirit, which induced the Bishop to change the place of his aboad, are propounded and examined.</head>
               <p>THESE therfore are ſome of the reaſons which euery Catholike man, though neuer ſo ſimple, is able to giue of his beliefe, and are ſo euident and iuſtified in themſelues, that there is no man hauing ſenſe of God, if he put them in the Ballance of his Iudgment, but he muſt needs feele their weight in his mind, and in his will the diuine power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them. Whereas on the other ſide, this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man the Biſhop, after 10. yeares ſtudy, writing to edify the world with his Motiues, can bring forth nothing, but that which appeareth at the firſt ſight to be falſe, &amp; as you haue heard, hath receiued ſentence of Iudgment three tymes already, being once of old condemned by the auncient Fathers, and twyce more in our age by the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts themſelues, who firſt condemned the Fathers as being againſt them, and afterwards alſo condemned the heretical doctrine of one another.</p>
               <p>And this may ſuffice to haue ſpoken of thoſe diſpoſitions and other conſiderations which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop accuſeth to haue been the cauſes and motiues of his change in religion. It followeth now to examine the groundes that induced him to change the place of his aboad. Which albeit he ſetteth downe very
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7997:122"/>confuſedly, I find they may be reduced to 3. prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heads. The firſt therfore was his danger in ſtaying. The ſecond, his ſpirit that compelled him to go. And the third, his zeale (forſooth) of truth and peace, that drew him on. As concerning his danger, he confeſſeth, that in <hi>Rome</hi> notice was taken of his writing againſt the Roman doctrine, and that more then once he had been admoniſhed, and reprehended for it by the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> or Agent, reſiding in <hi>Venice.</hi> In which reſpect he had iuſt cauſe to feare, that the Venetians, not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne a manifeſt heretike in their State, might eaſily be induced to deliuer him vp to the Nuntio, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at that tyme, they hauing need of the Pope in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their warrs: and that the Nuntio would haue ſent him vp to the Holy Houſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſhould haue byn receiued with ſuch kindnes as was agreable to his deſerts. Wherby it appeareth vpon the matter, that being entred ſo far into Hereſy, as he could not go back without great infamy, he ſound I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly to hoat for his foot, &amp; fled from thencefor no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good reſpect, but only becauſe he could ſtay no longer without the horrible feare of extreme danger.</p>
               <p>By the way of this diſcourſe, he putteth himſelfe into a great chafe againſt the Pope, &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide his diſguiſe of <hi>Monſignor fate voi,</hi> he ſheweth himſelfe a plaine Italian Facchine, without any truth, ciuility, or modeſty. And like your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer of <hi>Croydon,</hi> being a myte out of Towne, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his pleaſure of the Pope, &amp; rayleth againſt him moſt deſpiciouſly. And who is there that hath but ſoone the ſtate of <hi>Germany, Spaine, France,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:7997:123"/>and thereby knoweth, as he muſt needs, the great reputation and authority of the Catholike Clergy, and eſpecially of the Biſhops the heads of the Clergy, but will admire at his impudency, to heare him ſay: <q>That Catholike Biſhops, now adayes, haue nothing but the name of Biſhops: That they are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Pope to haue any gouennement of their Churches: That they are vilde and contemptible: and which is no leſſe vntrue, then the former: That they are made ſubiect to Religious Orders;</q> for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men except they be Biſhops, or indued with Epiſcopall authority, haue no exteriour iuriſdiction at all, neither ouer Biſhops, nor any ſecular perſons.</p>
               <p>To the reſt where he ſayth: That the Church of Rome, is wholy become a temporall Monarchy, a vineyard only to make <hi>Noë</hi> drunke, a flocke whoſe bloud the Paſtours ſucke, and the like; What ſhall we ſay, but that he ſheweth himſelf to be far worſe, then one of <hi>Noë</hi> his accurſed children, and to be no better then a wilde Boore, that would deſtroy the vineyard of Chriſt, or a rauenous Wolfe, that howleth againſt the Shepheard? Neither (all that went before being moſt falſe) will I grant that to be true, where he ſayth. That Chriſt hath placed him for a dog in his flocke. For the truth is, that he thruſt himſelfe in for a dogge, as I haue ſhewed long ago. But now at length it hath pleaſed God to put him out for a Curre, and ſo he ſheweth himſelfe to be, in barking againſt his Maiſter. In the end, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe vntruthes ſome colour and occaſion of his departure, at length he concludeth, that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd the Popes malice, which was ſo neer vnto him,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7997:123"/>and the ordinary effects therof, which he ſayth to be poyſon, and punyards, it was altogeather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to run away.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>An ill conſcience feareth the ſound of a flying leafe: and the noyſe of feare is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his eare, &amp; where peace is, he ſuſpecteth treaſon.</hi> In which reſpect, although it be not altogeather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that he feared poyſon and punyards as he ſayth, and it may very well be, that he had deſerued no better of ſome priuat Citizens in the place wher he liued: yet it is more likely that herein he would only ſhew his Rhetorike, thereby to draw the Pope into ſuſpition and enuy: And that he feareth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poyſon, but the fire, nor any other knife, but the ſword of the hangman, which I muſt needs ſay, ſetting all other cauſes apart, he well deſerueth for theſe monſtrous ſlaunders and foule imputations alone, wherwith he chargeth ſo worthy a Prince as the Pope, and a Seat ſo reuerend and ſacred as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he ſayth: That now adayes, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of the Church are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Deuines or Councells, but for the defence of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                  <q>&amp; from <hi>Rome,</hi> to Parricides, villaines, and murtherers; who knoweth not that all the poynts in Controuerſy at this day, were for many yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather diſputed, and diſcuſſed in the Councell of Trent:</q> and that the learned Deuines of the Church of Rome, haue defended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues moſt gloriouſly, as well by their excellent writings, as conſtant ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, wherof you need not go far to ſeeke exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Not ſtriking others treacherouſly, as this wolf pretendeth, but being ſtrucken vniuſtly: not giuing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7997:124"/>blowes, but receauing blow after blow: not murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others, but willingly ſuffering themſelues to be murthered: not ſeeking other mens liues, but giuing their owne liues for the teſtimony of their cauſe, and for the ſaluation of the ſoules of others.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop being thus couragiouſly reſolued to run away, with moſt extreme feare to be ſtayed or taken, he telleth you of a great conflict betweene himſelfe on the one party, and his hand-maid <hi>Agar</hi> with her Sonne <hi>Iſmaell</hi> on the other, viz. betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit. Of what colour the ſpirit was, I make no queſtion: but what fleſh he meaneth, whether his own, or ſome other bodys that tempted him to ſtay, I cannot ſo eaſily reſolue. For his own fleſh ſtood in feare of torture and torment, as you haue heard, and was already cloathed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of hereſy, that was bruted in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by al reaſon ſhould take part with his ſpirit that did ſo vehemently perſwade him to run away. But the fleſh that heere he bringeth into combat, putteth him in hope of eaſe, of pleaſure, &amp; preferment, and in feare of the infamy that might meet him in his iourney. Beſides it moueth a doubt vnto him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were wiſer, then other innumerable Biſhops that ſtayed behind him, which his owne fleſh could neuer haue done. For he knew, that he made no queſtion of the matter, and therfore he neuer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any of them to counſell. as he confeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor heere doth he vouchſafe any anſwere at all to that needleſſe obiection.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide; conſidering how like his fleſh is to the fleſh of <hi>Agar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.4.</note> that <hi>deſpiſed her Mistreſſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:7997:124"/>and being therefore corrected by her, <hi>fed</hi> from her, vntill at length not only her ſelfe, but alſo her ſon <hi>Iſmaell</hi> were both <hi>caſt forth into the deſert;</hi> as this man deſpiſed the Pope his Maiſter, &amp; being reprehended for it, ran quite away &amp; in the end was thrown forth out of the family of Chriſt, into the deſert of hereſy and infidelity: I ſay, all this conſidered, me thinks by <hi>Agar,</hi> he ſhould meane no other fleſh, but his owne. But whoſe fleſh ſoeuer this <hi>Agar</hi> was, I haue reaſon to thinke, that when he came to you, he carryed her ſonne <hi>Iſmaell</hi> with him into England. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpirit, which pleaded, as he ſayth, againſt the fleſh, &amp; did ſo much ſollicit his haſty departure, vnleſſe himſelfe had written it, I ſhould not haue thought, that with any reaſon, I could haue accuſed the Diuell to haue beene the authour of it. For what ſhould any ſpirit need to pray him go, that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vpon running, and nothing els, but a chayne could hold him. But now I ſee, that his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not content with his readynes, did puſh, and driue him healong on: &amp; that as before he had caſt him out of his order; ſo at this tyme he was at hand to caſt him forth out of the Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>This ſpirit he calleth Diuine, and ſayth, that with vehement impulſion it did not permit him to make any longer delay. And that he followed the ſame, as <hi>Abraham</hi> followed the voyce of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.10.</note> Alas poore man, if he be of any religion (whereof I haue great cauſe to doubt, for the cauſes aforeſayd) he is not the firſt, that truſting to his owne iudgment, and confiding himſelfe in the pleaſing phanſy of a priuate ſpirit, inſteed of God, hath adored the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7997:125"/>by whoſe meanes alſo he further ſaith, going from Venice towards England, he hopeth that his fame or good name, of what forme and beauty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, ſhalbe preſerued from all blemiſh, euen in the hands of the <hi>Barbarous.</hi> Which new Name of <hi>Barbarous</hi> (for any thing that I can ſee) you muſt be contented to receiue at the hands of your new God father, inſtead of a better bleſſing. And ſurely, albeit ſome inſolent Italians haue not ſpared to lay this rude imputation vpon other Nations: yet this <hi>Dalmatian,</hi> being ſcarſely an Italian himſelfe, and going to liue among them, and to be mayntained by them, both in diſcretion and ciuility, ſhould haue affoarded them ſome better title.</p>
               <p>As touching the preſeruation of his fame, whereof he ſpeaketh with great zeale and no little feare, as it ſeemeth, both heere and in other places of his booke; I cannot ſo eaſily coniecture, what it is he would haue, or what it is he feareth. For to be reputed an Heretike in Italy, in reſpect of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thence, and his going into England, is a thing farre off; and being of his mynd, and where he is, a man would thinke, he ſhould rather glory therein, then be aſhamed thereof. Wherefore it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that there is ſome great matter in the ſtraw, which is not yet diſcouered; &amp; that either he feareth the workes he left behind him, will come after him thither, and claime him for their Father: or els he is troubled with ſuch paſſions ſtill, as will quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit him, if prouiſion be not made, that his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes may either be cured, or well couered.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe perchance, he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7997:125"/>the reward of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe beautifull wife was preſerued from reproach in the hands of <hi>Pharao:</hi> and the ſaying of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that neither Countrey nor Parents, <hi>nor wife, nor children,</hi> ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs, from the execution of Gods will. For God ſaith he, giueth all things to vs (which words I would haue you marke) and is able to preſerue that which he giueth. Whereby it may be, that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty would giue you to vnderſtand, that either he hath a wife already, which I will not ſay; or that he would haue one, which is more likely, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his ſame amongſt you. Which if it be ſo, he need not to haue been ſo much aſhamed thereof, as to conceale it, if he had knowne in what playne termes ſome of his anceſtours, whoſe courſe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, domaunded the like ſauour.</p>
               <p>And that you may the leſſe maruell thereat, if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, I will ſet you downe part of an Epiſtle to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> written and ſubſcribed vnto by <hi>Swinglius, Leo, Iude, Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and 8. other Miniſters, who all of them cry out for wyues therein, and after ſome intimation made, of <hi>the heauenly doctrine ſo long hydden,</hi>

                  <hi>SECTION XXVIII.</hi> VVherein the Bishop his zeale, and deſire to try which is the laſt Motiue, that induced him to forſake his Countrey, is diſcuſſed.</head>
               <p>HIS third Motiue which he ſeemeth all this while to haue forgotten, he beginneth in this manner, pag. 28. <hi>Charuas tamen Chriſti ſuper omnia vrget me:</hi> but yet the Charity of Chriſt vrgeth me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things. Which when I read, I could not chuſe but ſmyle, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring how one that was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with vermyne in Italy, went ſhrugging vp and downe, and ſinging that verſe of Petrarch; <hi>S'amor non è, che dunque è quel ch'to ſento?</hi> If loue it be not, what is that I feele? For it is very probable that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty and famine began to pinch him, as not hauing ſufficient to feed his maw, after he had reſigned his poore Biſhoprike to his Nephew, as I haue ſhewed: And the Italian might better compare his life to naughty loue, then the Biſhop his counterfeit chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the diuine loue of Ieſus Chriſt; ſo that the one, if he had thought his life to be loue, ſhould haue
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7997:126"/>been no leſſe miſtaken then the other. This charity (ſayth he) did vrge him to cry. And to get him vp to ſome high place, that his cry might be heard the further, if you had euer been in Venice, you would imagine him to be poſſeſt with the ſpirit of ſome Montebanck, not only in reſpect of his mounting and crying: but alſo in reſpect of his diſcourſe. For with a great many arrogant tearmes, and boaſting words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſedly vttered, you would thinke he meant to ſell the wares of his new booke, as Montebancks ſell boxes.</p>
               <p>But for orders ſake, I will reduce all that he ſayth to three heads. For either he ſheweth what it is that he intendeth to cry, or what authority he hath to cry, or anſwereth certayne obiections that might be made againſt his crying. <hi>I expected iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

                  <hi>and behold iniquity; and iuſtice, and behold a cry. Me thinkes</hi> (as S. Auguſtine ſaid to a Donatiſt) <hi>that part of the world ſhould ſuffice him, wherein our Lord would, that the chiefe of his Apoſtles ſhould be crowned with a moſt glorious Martyrdome. For what could the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of that Church anſwere, but that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Seat, and the Roman Church doth anciently hold with others?</hi> or at leaſt, that the authority of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth <hi>the Confeſsion of mankind,</hi> might haue ſuffiſed to haue kept this man in quietneſſe, and obedience: but <hi>inſteed of iudgment behold iniquity; and inſteed of iuſtice, behold a cry.</hi> For this man is ſo farre from <hi>hearing,</hi> and obaying <hi>the Church,</hi> which our Sauiour hath appointed to teach him, that being worſe then an Infidell, he cryeth againſt the Church; and with extreme arrogancy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7997:127"/>would inforce the Church to belieue him, and to be obedient vnto him. That which he intendeth to cry, is the matter of his booke of Chriſtian Common Wealth, whereof he vaunteth, as if therby the world ſhould know,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 28.33.</note> what a champion the Proteſtants haue gotten for them. For by meanes thereof, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be made manifeſt, <q>and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Proteſtant doctrine ſhalbe no longer hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and a number of their Churches, reiected by that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhalbe declared Catholike; and the way of making peace and vnion ouer all the world,</q> ſhalbe cleerly manifeſted. And all this, he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with ſuch confidence, and preſumption, as if with him the Catholike verity were turned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: or as if he had gotten a Monopoly of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, and that no part thereof were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, without his marke, or licence and with his approbation, that any Religion might paſſe for currant. Of this booke of his he ſpeaketh euery where with ſuch admiration, as a man may eaſily perceiue, it is the Idol that he adoreth; and was doubtleſſe the principall cauſe of his fall; and for the loue of it, more then any thing els, he was content to renounce both his Faith and Countrey. But as Idolls are nothing, ſo I haue ſhewed ſufficiently, that this Idoll of his contayneth nothing. And though it were neuer ſo ſtrong and ſubſtantiall: yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming once forth, and falling vpon the ſtone of <hi>Peter,</hi> which is the Rock of the Church, wherat it aymeth, it muſt needs be broken all to peeces.</p>
               <p>And conſidering with my ſelfe what the cauſe might be, that all this while it is not publiſhed, I
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7997:127"/>am perſwaded, that the Proteſtants themſelues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the deformity thereof, and eſpecially the clouen foot of the Diuell, I meane the deniall of all Iuriſdiction in the Church of God, which is the crutch wheron it ſtandeth, were either affrayed, or aſhamed to prynt it: which if it be true, we ſhall ſhortly heare that either he will take the courſe, that <hi>Achitophel</hi> did when his Counſell was contemned, or els that before it be long, forſaking Kent and Chriſtendome, he will turne himſelfe towards the Turkes and Gentiles. And indeed intending as he doth, to take away the occaſion of Schiſme, not by eſtabliſhing one head vpon earth, as our Sauiour did, but by beating downe the ſame: not by order of Iuriſdiction, but by the diſorder of licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, any man may perceiue it is a Diuelliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, not to bring forth vnion, but to breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, nor to gather with Chriſt, but to ſcatter with Antichriſt. And therefore the Cryer himſelfe, conſidering the matter a little better, and being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to diſcouer in playne tearmes his wicked mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, correcteth himſelfe afterward, and inſtead of demonſtrating the way of this vnion which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before, he ſaith afterward, that if he do not open the ſame, he wilbe contented to nod, and poynt at it with his finger. As for his defence of the Proteſtant doctrine, I haue ſufficiently declared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that by taking the ſame vpon him, he is not only 20. tymes condemned for an Heretike by the auncient Fathers, but alſo pronounced to be <hi>Inſatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, ſuperſathanized, a ſlaue of the Diuell, one of the Antichriſtian ſwyniſh Rabble,</hi> and a thouſand tymes
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7997:128"/>as bad by the Proteſtants themſelues: wherein, as in other things, the Biſhop himſelfe will needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that you may ſafely belieue them.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond poynt, he ſheweth that being a Biſhop, he hath ſufficient authority, not only to reprehend the mannets &amp; vices of the tyme, for the which no man perchance would haue blamed him, if he had done it with charity and diſcretion; but alſo to cry as he doth againſt the errours of the Roman Church, and of all other Churches vnited with it. For that the vniuerſall Church, ſayth he, in ſome caſes is committed to the care of euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Biſhop: wherof will follow this ſtrange poſition, that it ſhould belong to the office of euery particuler Biſhop in ſome occaſion to accuſe the whole Church of errour, wherunto this Cryer himſelfe, according to his owne doctrine, muſt haue thought himſelfe obliged in conſcience, if he had beene borne in the tyme of his Father Luther: of the abſurdity wherof I haue ſpoken ſufficiently already.</p>
               <p>And no leſſe ſtrange and abſurd is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, which he himſelfe inferreth, that any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop whatſouer hath authority to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any other Biſhop. For example: That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Spalato</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> hath authority to viſit and reforme the Biſhop of Canterbury, when the Dalmatia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal iudg &amp; eſteeme it to be ſo expedient. But becauſe he thought it might ſeeme to be ſome new deuiſe, being no leſſe contrary to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, then to the Catholike Religion, <hi>Monſignor fate voi</hi> hauing al this while taken vp whatſoeuer he ſayd, vpon the credit of his reader; in this place, as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7997:128"/>fearing at length to be diſcouered for a counterfeit, beginneth a little to proue his aſſertion, and to pay his Reader with ſuch money, as he receiued of thoſe that hyred him to play the Epiſcopall Doctour on your ſide the mountaynes. But I thinke you will eaſily diſcerne by the falſe ſound, what coyne it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as far different from any currant proofe, as <hi>Fate voi,</hi> from a reuerend Biſhop. For thus he reaſoneth.</p>
               <p>All Biſhops togeather haue the gouernment of the whole Church of Chriſt, as he proueth out of the Scripture, out of <hi>S. Eleutherius,</hi> and <hi>S. Cyprian:</hi> therefore euery Biſhop in particuler hath the like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. As if one ſhould ſay, All the Officers of the Court do gouerne the whole Court vnder the King: therefore euery Officer in particuler hath authority ouer the whole Court vnder the King. Or thus, All the Britans togeather are the Lords of great Britany: therefore euery Britan in particuler is Lord ouer all Britany. Which miſerable argument he likewiſe confirmeth in this pittifull manner: Euery Biſhop may counſell, help, &amp; ſuccour the neceſſityes of any other Church or Biſhopricke, as it is manifeſt by the example of many ancient Fathers: Therfore euery Biſhop hath authority ouer all other Churches. As much as to ſay, euery man may help the neceſſityes of his Neighbour, and the ſeruant of his Maiſter: therfore Euery man hath authority ouer his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or the ſeruant ouer his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>But letting paſſe the weaknes of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it is the firſt, and becauſe it may be, that for want of vſe, he hath forgotten how to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue; let him ſhew you, but one auncient Father.

               <head>SECTION XXIX. <hi>The firſt obiection of the Bishop againſt himſelfe, is diſcuſſed: VVherin he affirmeth,</hi> tha al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the King ought to be feared, and may not be reprehended: yet that the Pope is not to be feared &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE obiections which he anſwereth as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be made againſt himſelfe, are 2. in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But the firſt, vnder the colour of an obiection is nothing els, but an egregious peece of flattery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from the Turkiſh Diuinity of his Neighbour Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. The obiection may be framed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Maieſty of an earthly King is to be feared: <q>and he ought not to be reprehended or admoniſhed of his fault, but by a Prophet ſent from God: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maieſty of the Pope, ought likewiſe to be feared, and ought not to be accuſed of Hereſy, but by a Prophet rayſed vp by God for that purpoſe.</q> The Antecedent, that a King ought not to be rebuked or admoniſhed of his fault, but by a Prophet ſent from heauen, he eaſily admitteth, being the poynt of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7997:133"/>adulation which he intendeth, and thereby as it ſeemeth, would gladly bring in the Turkiſh manner of Gouernement into our Countrey: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto the King ſuch abſolute commaund, and Tyrannicall power, ouer the liues, and fortunes, and ſoules of his ſubiects, that whatſoeuer he did, or what Hereſy or falſe worſhip ſoeuer he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, no man might reprehend him for his fault, or put him in mind of his duty. Wherein I am ſure, the gracious Maieſty of our Prince, is ſo farre from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding his Sycophancy, that he deteſteth his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. But this propoſition, your Turkiſh Doctour doth not only teach out of the <hi>Alcaron:</hi> but alſo goeth about to proue out of the Bible. For King <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſayth he, hauing committed Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was not rebuked for it by any Prieſt or Leuit, but by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet. From which particuler the ſilly man, not conſidering that the ſinne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was ſecret, for the which cauſe a Prophet was ſent to reproue him, inferreth a generall: That no King ought to be reproued but by a Prophet. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by all likelyhood, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected but by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> as the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that their Emperours ought to be reformed by no other, but by their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he commeth. And his argument is as good, as if he ſhould haue ſayd; <hi>Sarah</hi> when ſhe <hi>laughed,</hi> was not rebuked by <hi>Abraham</hi> her husband, but by an <hi>Angell:</hi> therefore no marryed woman when ſhe offendeth ought to be reprehended by her husband, but by an Angell. Which argument, if he can make good, he might perhaps haue many followers that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7997:133"/>him well, for intituling them with ſuch aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient right to weare the breeches.</p>
               <p>Or to come nearer to him, ſo well he might haue argued in this manner: <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe was beaten by a Prophet, and therefore no Aſſe ought to be beaten, but only by a Prophet. Which if it were true, <hi>Monſignor fate voi</hi> might haue eſcaped with fewer blowes then he is like to do if his bookes come forth, there being ſo many that ſtand ready with <hi>Baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> in their hands to wayt vpon him.

That the Maieſty of the Pope is not to be feared; and that we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Almighty God ſhould ſend any particuler meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to reforme him.

               <p>That which he ſayth, We are not to expect, that any Prophet ſhould be ſent from God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Pope: if he meant for profeſſing hereſy, or falſe doctrine, were moſt true in one reſpect. For in the old Law which was vnperfect, we neuer read that any Prophet was ſent to reproue the hygh Prieſt of errour;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8.</note> but rather, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> obſerued a little before, ſuch as would not obay him, in the deciſion of all Controuerſies brought before him, were <hi>to dye</hi> the death, <hi>by the ſentence of the Iudge: that all the people hearing, might feare; and that none ſhould ſwell with pryde thence forward.</hi> And therefore in the new Law, which is the perfection of the old, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe hath founded his Church vpon S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſours, with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>that the Gates of hell</hi> (which principally are errours and hereſies) <hi>ſhall not preuaile againſt it,</hi> as hath been ſhewed at large,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18.</note> through many Sections of this treatiſe, much leſſe can any ſuch Prophet be expected, except he be one of thoſe, that ſhall come <hi>cloathed like a ſheep</hi> without,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15.</note> but within is <hi>a rauening wolfe,</hi> and muſt be ſent from the Diuell to deceiue the world, &amp; to oppoſe himſelf againſt the Church, and againſt the foundation of the Church, which is the Chayre of <hi>Peter.</hi> But how, I pray you, doth he proue, that the Pope ought not to be feared, but that he may be corrected of euery Biſhop? In truth,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7997:134"/>as wiſely as he proued before, that the King in no caſe ought to be told of his fault, or to be reproued by any but a Prophet. For (ſaith he) all Biſhops are brothers, and fellow-ſeruants. And may not the ſame be likewiſe affirmed of all Chriſtians, that they are brethren and fellow ſeruants? Wherfore, if no brother be to be feared, it will follow thereof, that the King himſelfe is not much to be reſpected. And this is likely to be the Biſhops doctrine in priuate, howſoeuer in publike, with neuer ſo much flattery and adulation, he pretend the contrary. For his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to proue, that we ought not to ſtand in awe of the Pope, concludeth, that we ſhould not dread the King, as before I haue ſhewed; that taking away all ſpirituall iuriſdiction, it followeth vpon the ſame ground, that he muſt likewiſe deny the temporall. All Biſhops are brethren indeed, but as they are to reuerence our Sauiour their Elder brother: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are to be ſubiect to the ſucceſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> whome our Sauiour appoynted to ſupply his place, and to feed them as his ſheep in his abſence. As all Biſhops are brethren, ſo likewiſe it is true that they are fellow ſeruants, but yet notwithſtanding one was principally <hi>appoynted ouer the family,</hi>

               <p>HIS ſecond &amp; laſt obiection, which he maketh againſt himſelfe is this: That forſaking the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he calleth <hi>Babylon,</hi> he may ſeeme to haue incurred the cryme of Schiſme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he anſwereth ſaying: I will that this my flight or profectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be free from all ſuſpition of Schiſme. <hi>If Monſignor fate voy</hi> when he fell into the hands of the Merchants, that had beene deceiued by him, ſhould haue ſayd, I will be free from beating; do you thinke it would haue ſerued his turne? Truly, both theſe <hi>Monſignors</hi> hauing ſo well deſerued their fees, as the blowes fell vpon the one, notwithſtanding his good deſire to the contrary: ſo not only the ſuſpition, but alſo the infamy both of Schiſme and Hereſy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or will not, muſt light vpon the other. But becauſe it is manifeſt, that there is a Schiſme, or diuiſion betweene the Pope and him, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that all things conſidered, not himſelfe, but the Pope muſt needs be the Schiſmatike, which he ſeemeth to proue: firſt by reaſon, and ſecondly by the authority, and example of S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> His reaſon is this in effect. <q>He that maketh new Articles of fayth, either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, or not contayned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ancient Creeds; and admitteth for Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7997:136"/>of Fayth, ſuch things as are indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and were neuer ſufficiently defyned by the Church, and condemneth thoſe for heretiks, whom the Church hath not ſufficiently condemned, he is the Schiſmaticke.

               <p>But to giue you ſome light heerin, you muſt vnderſtand, that according to the Catholike doctrine, any Controuerſy in matter of Faith, may be ſufficiently defyned foure manner of wayes. That is to ſay: Firſt by the vniuerſall conſent and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beliefe of all the Faithfull: for, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it is impoſſible the vniuerſal Church ſhould erre in matter of Faith.<note place="margin">Aug. l. de haereſ. in fine.</note> And therfore <hi>S.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a generall Councell confirmed by the Pope: or laſtly by the definition of the Pope himſelfe, decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame for the direction of the faythfull, and eſtabliſhment of the peace of the Church, as hath
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7997:136"/>been proued at large in the former Sections of the Popes Supremacy.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the queſtion between the Pope and the Biſhop in this place concerneth Schiſme &amp; Hereſy, you are further to vnderſtand; that Schiſm according to the ſenſe of the word, ſignifieth a ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or diuiſion of minds, which is oppoſed to vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſequently to Charity, which doth vnite the minds of the Faythfull. And becauſe the greateſt vnity in the Church, is that of the whole body, which proceedeth from all the members with the head, and whereunto the vnity and Charity of the particuler members among themſelues, is naturally referred, as the part to the whole: from hence it is, that Schiſme being taken for ſuch a great diſſention,<note place="margin">S.

                  <hi>or diſſention from the Biſhop.</hi> So <hi>Miletius</hi> making a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation againſt Peter Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his Superiour, was accompted a Schiſmaticke, and no Heretike: For as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſayth, <hi>his faith was neuer changed from the Catholike Church.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> being made Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> againſt the will of <hi>Donatus,</hi> who obiected many crimes vnto him, and with his followers departed from him; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts in the beginning were acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted Schiſmatiks.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:7997:137"/>
               <p>And in the ſame manner <hi>Optatus</hi> to proue <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> &amp; not <hi>Cecilian</hi> to be the Schiſmatike, argueth in this manner. <hi>For</hi> Cecilian (ſayth he) <hi>went not out from Maiorinus thy predeceſſour, but Maiorinus from Cecilian: Neither did Cecilian depart from the Chayre of</hi> Peter, <hi>or of</hi> Cyprian, <hi>but</hi> Maiorinus, <hi>in whoſe chayre thou ſucceedeſt, and which before him had no beginning.</hi> Wherfore in our caſe, it wilbe an eaſy matter to find out of theſe two, the Pope, or this Biſhop, which is the Sciſmatike. For the Biſhop rebelling againſt the Pope his Superiour, if not by diuine, yet at leaſt by humaine law, as himſelfe will confeſſe, <hi>diſſenting</hi> from the chiefe <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>and departing from the Chayre of Peter,</hi> and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe vnto another Congregation, moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite thereunto; it is more abſurd for him to accuſe the Pope of ſchiſme, then for a ſubiect taking armes againſt his Prince, or ioyning with his enemyes, to acuſe the Prince himſelfe of rebellion and treaſon: Eſpecially charging the Pope, as he doth, with falſe doctrine, which he would haue you belieue to be the cauſe of his ſchiſme. For the Pope being the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable Rock, and the foundation of true Fayth, which Chriſt himſelfe hath layd; the Biſhop in this caſe fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembleth one, that launching from the ſhore whereupon he fixeth his eye, ſhould ſweare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that the land departed from the boat, and that the boat it ſelfe ſtood ſtill, or remayned imoueable. In which caſe, I cannot tell, whether he in the boat ſhould ſhew himſelfe more ridiculous to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, then the Biſhop doth manifeſt himſelfe by this occaſion to his iudicious Readers.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:7997:137"/>
               <p>And thus much may ſuffice for the Biſhops ſchiſme. Hereſy is defined by S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>

                  <hi>to be a peruerſe doctrine, contrary to the rule of truth:</hi> which himſelfe doth better expound, where he ſayth: <hi>That it is an opinion, declyning from the rule, and turning men away from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Catholike Church:</hi> where he vnderſtandeth, the rule of truth, to be no other, then the doctrine of the Catholike Church: for without this ground all other rules are inſufficient, as hath been ſhewed, and the ſame if it were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, might eaſily be confirmed out of the reſt of the Fathers. Wherefore the doctrine of the Catholike Church, being made knowne and manifeſted vnto vs, either by the common beliefe of all the faithfull; or by the vniforme conſent, and common doctrine of all the Fathers, or by a generall Councell, or by the definition of the Pope, as before I noted, hauing conuinced the Biſhop of ſchiſme, though much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will; let vs ſee how he can cleare and ſhift himſelfe from the imputation of hereſy. For firſt, it cannot be denied; That whatſoeuer the Catholikes at this day, do maintaine to be the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles againſt the Proteſtants, was the generall beliefe of the vniuerſall Church, when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> began to broach his new doctrine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop condemning the Pope of many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in poynts of Controuerſy betweene him and the Proteſtants,<note place="margin">Vbi ſupra.</note> condemneth likewiſe the vniuerſall Church of that tyme, which as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, is moſt <hi>inſolent madnes, extreme impiety, and hayre-bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd, or furious ignorance.</hi> Secondly, you haue heard, how the auncient Fathers of the primitiue Church,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7997:138"/>haue condemned for hereſyes, aboue twenty ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinions of the Proteſtants. And therefore the Biſhop being now a Proteſtant, is likewiſe aboue twenty tymes condemned by them.</p>
               <p>And to omit, that other ſeuerall ſects of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, do all condemne him in like manner; the generall Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> hath defined the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Pope againſt the Proteſtants to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall, and the contrary opinions to be likewiſe hereticall. And the Biſhop ſeeming to belieue, that a generall Councell lawfully called and confirmed, cannot erre in matter of fayth, as hauing the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, leading vnto all truth, according to the promiſe of our Sauiour; hath no more reaſon to contemne the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> then to reiect the Councell of <hi>Nyce,</hi> or any other generall Councell. Laſtly, hauing proued by the common doctrine of all the Fathers, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> being ſucceſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> cannot erre, in defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Controuerſyes that belong to fayth, and that the Fathers put no difference, betweene the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and the Roman Church, but that the ſame Church, which is ſurmaned Catholike, becauſe it is vniuerſall is alſo called the Roman Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Roman Church, being founded in the Seat of <hi>Peter,</hi> is alwayes conioyned, and vnyted with the Catholike Church: it followeth thereof, that the Biſhop being condemned for an Heretike by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſucceſſour vnto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> founded in the Seat of <hi>Peter,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the iudgment of the auncient Fathers, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth likewiſe condemned in this reſpect alſo by the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7997:138"/>whole Church. And therefore hauing ſo many dreadfull ſentences lying heauily vpon him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he amend and make <hi>peace with his aduerſary,</hi>

                  <hi>while he is yet vpon the way:</hi> what can he expect at the day of iudgement, but that Chriſt himſelfe withall his Saints and Angells, togeather with the whole world ſhould condemne him? And with this we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his ſecond defence, which is, the authority and example of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> wherein he ſeemeth to ſet vp his reſt.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7997:139"/>
                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he propoundeth in ſuch manner, as that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing S. <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>indiſcretion;</hi> and that with his excommunications he was <hi>falling headlong into the miſchiefe of ſchiſme,</hi> he ſayth: That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Roman, <q>and almoſt from the vniuerſal Church about the Baptiſme of Heretikes, and being ſtrong in his owne opinion, and eſteeming <hi>Stephen</hi> the Pope to erre vehemently, and all the reſt to be in manifeſt errour; yet notwithſtanding, he neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the band of vnion, and Chriſtian charity, to be broken betweene them; but choſe to communicate not only with <hi>Stephen,</hi> being of a contrary opinion, and indeauour againſt him; but alſo with thoſe, whome he reputed to be altogeather impure, being moued thereunto, becauſe <hi>Stephen</hi> had receiued them into communion with him; rather then by ſchiſme to make a diuiſion in the Church of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which authority and example of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> he thinketh to haue clearely diſcouered where the fault lyeth, and to whom the crime of Schiſme is to be imputed, and ſo thinke I too. And here to curry a little fauour with him, or rather to curry him with ſome fauour, becauſe he hath ſo well deſerued it in this allegation of S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> albeit I cannot learne that euer he read, or heard Rhetorike among the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, as he himſelfe affirmeth; yet I will not deny it, but rather I will acknowledge, that he hath not been altogeather a Truant in the Schoole of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For though his booke be very ſmall, yet he hath been able to deliuer little or no matter at all in very many words. And he ſeemeth to couer many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, vnder the colour of Rhetoricall Hyperboles.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7997:139"/>And in this place by way of a friendly exhortation to peace and amendement he accuſeth the Pope of many foule crymes, and addreſſeth his ſpeach vnto him, in this manner. Let vs obſerue the famous ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> iudging no man, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating no man: let vs imitate <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp;c. as if he being free from all fault himſelfe, he had great compaſſion of the Popes vniuſt proceeding, perſwading him with all charity to reforme himſelfe; only he hath one trick which I know not how it can ſtand with the art of Rhetorick, and it is this; that commonly through all his booke he ſpeaketh againſt himſelfe, or produceth ſuch matter, as moſt eaſily, and moſt ſtrongly may be vrged againſt him. Whether it be his ill luck, or a fault in Nature, or the iudgment of God vpon thoſe that falling from the Catholike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, attempt to write againſt it, I know not But this I dare ſay, that he neuer learned this poynt of Rhetorike among the Ieſuits. Firſt therefore, as in other paſſages of his booke, you haue ſeene all that he hath ſayd, to haue been retorted againſt him: ſo in the ſame manner, we will examyne in this place, how much this allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth make for his purpoſe. For the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy betweene S <hi>Stephen</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> being about the baptizing of thoſe that were before baptized by heretikes, which could not be determyned by Scripture alone; the deciſion thereof, by the tradition of the Church, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> opinion by the <hi>Nicen</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, doth euidently proue the neceſſity of tradition againſt the Proteſtants, of whome the Biſhop hath made himſelfe one: and that the Scripture alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7997:140"/>be in all matters a ſufficient Iudge of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes. For as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth: <hi>that cuſtome which was oppoſed to</hi> Cyprian,<note place="margin">Aug. de bapt. cont. Donat. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ought to be belieued to haue taken his beginning from the tradition of the Apoſtles; as there are many things, which the vniuerſall Church doth hold, and for this cauſe, are rightly belieued to haue been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Apoſtles, albeit they be not found to be written.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I would know the reaſon of this great change and ſtrang conuerſion of things, why, as <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſayth, the authors of the ſelfe ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſhould be acknowledged for Catholikes, and the followers therfore ſhould be iudged Heretikes: the Maiſters ſhould be acquitted, the diſciples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: The writers of the ſame bookes ſhould be receiued into heauen, and the mayntainers of them ſhut vp in hell: For the latter did no more oppoſe themſelues, againſt the Scripture, then the former; and both of them ſeeme to haue alleadged more Scripture in the defence of their opinions, then the Catholikes that oppoſed themſelues againſt them. Wherfore no other reaſon can be giuen thereof, but only this: That in the time of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> and his predeceſſors, who were the authors of this opinion of rebaptizing Hereticks, the controuerſie was no way defined; which being afterwards determined, the Donatiſts that reuiued the ſame againſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife of the whole Church, were iuſtly condemned: and this kind of condemnation being once admitted, the Proteſtants that haue broached and retayned ſo many opinions, againſt the generall beleife of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church, ſince the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> and haue

               <p>Thirdly, wheras <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> ſayd to the reſt of the Councell, that none amongſt them did make himſelfe the Biſhop of Biſhops: becauſe <hi>Marke An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> would haue it ſeeme, that he taxed Pope <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> therin, who ſubſcribed his letters with that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; it muſt needs be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that thoſe words were improuidently alleadged by this Proteſtant Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For as to haue vſurped ſo great a title had bene as great a crime as could be imagined, and ſuch as that all the Biſhops in the world had bene bound in conſcience to haue oppoſed themſelues againſt <hi>S. Stephen</hi> for it, more then againſt any hereſie which thoſe times produced: ſo <hi>S. Stephen</hi> liuing in the 2. age, and being a man ſo renowned for ſanctity and martyrdome as he is, by the vſe of this title, affordeth vs a moſt forcible, and inuincible argument of the Popes Supremacy. For writing himſelfe the Biſhop of Biſhops, he could intend no leſſe, nor be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vnderſtood, then that he profeſſed himſelfe the head, and the chiefe of all other Biſhops. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be further confirmed, becauſe he inuented not this title of himſelf, but receiued it from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
               <p>Wherof his zeale in preſeruing the tradition of antiquity againſt all kind of nouelty, may ſerue for a ſufficient argument; and <hi>Baronius</hi> proueth out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that it was an ancient cuſtome before the

               <p>Whereby it appeareth, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confide ſo much in his owne priuate opinion, nor did oppoſe himſelfe almoſt againſt all others, as in this place he is falſely calumniated by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling enemy. Nor is it true, that he was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, either that S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> or the reſt were in a manifeſt errour; or that ſuch as had been conuerted from hereſy were altogeather impure, as his audacious cenſurer would make vs belieue. For in the very words alleaged by him, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to iudge of no man: and the cauſe of his Anger againſt Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> was, becauſe the Pope had written vnto him, that he thought thoſe who rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized heretikes, were to be condemned of errour. Wherefore, it is euident that S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> held it only a matter indifferent; albeit in hatred of heretikes, he thought it beſt at that tyme to baptize all thoſe that were conuerted from them. So that you ſee how fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and how fondly, this Moiſten of Rhetorike char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth S. <hi>Stephen</hi> with no little want of conſcience, &amp; obſtinacy in his owne opinion, whom he thought to extoll aboue meaſure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this allegation, he diſcouereth ſuch malice againſt the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth &amp; exrendeth it ſelfe, euen to the Saints of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and condemneth S <hi>Stephen</hi> of indiſcretion, of importune exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of others, &amp; of caſting himſelfe into extreme perill of ſchiſme and diuiſion:

                  </hi> vndertaking a wrong cauſe, and proceeding more violently againſt the Pope, then was conuenient, euen by the iudgment of all antiquity. For <hi>S Stephen</hi> the Pope, who liued in the ſecond age after Chriſt, gouerned the Church with great renowne, &amp; dyed a glorious Martyr, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe in ſuch manner, in this very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy of rebaptization, that hauing the flower of Chriſtendome, and ſo many Biſhops both of the Eaſt and of the Weſt, of Greece, Aegypt, and of Affrica in ſuch number againſt him, in the tyme of a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible perſecution, he brought them all to renounce their opinions, and to make peace and concord in their ſeuerall Countreys,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>3.4</hi> Hier. cont.

Cyprian, <hi>that heretikes ought to be rebaptized, made a new decree to the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> ſayth, <hi>that it is very agreable, that we ſhould iudge of ſuch a man, that he corrected his opinion.</hi> And the reaſon for it is moſt apparant. For who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that all the reſt recanting, and all the world agreeing in one, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> alone, being a man of ſuch emynent vertue, and dying as he did a glorious Martyr, ſhould obſtinatly perſiſt in his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that it may be truly ſayd, that by the care and indeauour of Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> this opinion was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally condemned by the whole Church, before it receiued ſentence in the Nicen Councell, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it did. Whereof the aforeſayd <hi>Vincentius Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> writeth with great admiration in this manner:

                  <hi>Wherefore, as all, from all parts, began to reclayme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nouelty of the matter, and that all Prieſts euery where, each one for his owne part, did ſtriue againſt it: ſo</hi> Stephen <hi>the Pope of bleſſed memory, the Antiſtes of the Apoſtolicall Seat, with the reſt of his Colleagues, but yet more then the reſt, made reſistance thereunto: Thinking it agreable, as may be imagined, to go beyond all others in the deuotion of his faith, as he did ſurpaſſe them in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his place. To conclude; in his Epiſtle which was ſent into Affrick, he made this ſolemne Decree: Nothing must be innouated, only that which was deliuered muſt be conſerued. For the holy and prudent man did iudge, that nothing was to be admitted vnder the colour of piety, but that all things ſhould be conſigned with the ſame faith to the children, with which fayth they were receiued from the Fathers.</hi> And a little after, he concludeth. <hi>But what was the end of all thoſe buyſneſſes? what end could it haue, but that which is vſuall and accuſtomed: That is to ſay, antiquity was retayned, and nouelty was reiected.</hi>

For not only the Latins, but alſo the Greekes, did annually celebrate his memory, which is an honour that few Martyrs of the Weſterne Church haue receiued. And the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> themſelues who reuyled the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> did ſo much reſpect the eminent

                  <hi>he could not be touched with any fault in the diſcharge of his Office.</hi> And therefore, if S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> were now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, much more would he admire the audacious preſumption of this later heretike, in calumniating, and condemning his proceedings.</p>

               <p>VVHERFORE this one authority alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Biſhop being almoſt all the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7997:148"/>matter of ſubſtance, and almoſt the only proofe which he bringeth for any thing he ſayth in his whole booke, taking vp all things vpon truſt, as hath been obſerued: you ſee notwithſtanding, how that out of this one place of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alleadged by him, we haue proued the Popes Supremacy, and the neceſſity not only of tradition, but alſo of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, for the defyning of matters in Controuerſy, and for the condemning of hereſy. Beſides, we haue ſhewed how notoriouſly he falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, &amp; how he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth not only S <hi>Stephen</hi> moſt impiouſly: but alſo S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> moſt abſurdly, whome he ſought moſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. And now, that you may perceiue, how much this authority of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> maketh not only againſt his cauſe in generall, and his owne credit in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, but alſo againſt himſelfe, in the very poynt, for the proofe and declaration whereof, it is inſerted by him; Thus I argue.</p>
               <p>He that without authority, condemneth any other Biſhop, and refuſeth to hold communion with him, according to S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> may be iudged a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike, or to giue occaſion of ſchiſme: but <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> condemneth without authority, not only his Colleague, but alſo his Superiour the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> not of one errour, but of inumerable hereſies: not of any ordinary fault, but of ſuppreſſing the Councells, of deprauing the Scriptures, and ancient Fathers: of vſurpation and tyrany ouer the Church of God, oppreſſing, pilling, and ſpoyling the ſame, and ſucking the bloud of the members thereof: And by conſequence he condemneth likewiſe all other
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7997:148"/>Biſhops, that communicate with him, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to him: &amp; calleth the vniuerſall Church, which is vnder the obedience of the Pope, by the name of Babylon that is to ſay, the Citty or congregation of the Diuell. Therefore <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> is a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike, according to his owne diſcourſe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the words of <hi>S. Cyprian:</hi> which he fondly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth to proue the contrary. Secondly according to the proceſſe of his owne diſcourſe, I argue thus. He that goeth againſt the example of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the vniuerſall Church, for the auoyding of ſchiſme, falleth into the cryme of ſchiſme: But <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> goeth directly againſt the example of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> propounded by himſelfe, as a rule for the auoyding of ſchiſme: Therfore <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> according to his owne rule, is falne into the cryme of ſchiſme. That <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> hath proceeded againſt his owne rule, and the example of S <hi>Cyprian</hi> which he propoundeth, is a thing moſt manifeſt. For, whereas S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> notwithſtanding that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Pope &amp; almoſt all the vniuerſall Church, to be in manifeſt errour; would neuer depart from the communion of the Pope, but reſpected him ſo much, that he communicated with thoſe whome he held impure, only becauſe the Pope receiued them into his communion: <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> in the ſame caſe, hath not only forſaken the Pope, but alſo all thoſe that are vnited with him, whome otherwiſe, he thinketh not impur; e only becauſe they do not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelues from the Pope, but ſtill remayne in his communion. Wherfore theſe two arguments produced by himſelfe, are ſo conuincing, that there
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7997:149"/>needeth nothing els to confound him. So that this proofe of his out of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> being the ſubſtance of his booke, and being withall ſo contrary to his cauſe, to his credit, and to himſelfe in the poynt of Schiſme, whereof he intended to cleare himſelfe therby, may be ſufficient to giue you to vnderſtand of what ſubſtance, the matter of his other booke is like to be when it ſhalbe printed. For my part I am verily perſwaded, if it be well vnderſtood, it wilbe found, to be more againſt the Proteſtants, then the Catholikes, and more contrary to himſelfe, then to either of the other</p>
               <p>And now to draw towards an end of this matter in the allegation of this authority out of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he is ſo much the more to be blamed, in that being of ſuch force againſt himſelfe, for as much thereof as concerneth the Popes authority, it may full eaſily be anſwered. For thoſe words of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> That none of them made himſelfe the Biſhop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops &amp;c. may very well be vnderſtood of thoſe that were preſent at that Councell, and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in that ſentence, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who truly may be ſayd to be the Biſhop of Biſhops, the Father of Fathers, the Biſhop and Father of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church, and the like, as hath been ſhewed. That which he ſayth, A Biſhop cannot be iudged but by God alone, as he receiueth his authority from God alone; ought to be vnderſtood, that he cannot be iudged in thoſe things which are doubtfull, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and hidden.<note place="margin">Aug. l. <hi>3.</hi> de baptiſ. cap. <hi>3.</hi>

               <p>But now to do him a pleaſure, let vs ſuppoſe that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in theſe words did glance at S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and that he meant to taxe him, for proceding as he thought too rigorouſly againſt him: with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or with what honeſty, I pray you, can this ſtrange Biſhop alleadge theſe words of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſpoken in the defence of a wrong cauſe, as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion &amp; anger againſt the Pope (of the which it is moſt probable, and according to <hi>S.

                  <hi>SECTION XXXIIII.</hi> Many teſtimonyes and playne places are produced out of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> wherby the Bishop is euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuinced both of Schiſme and Hereſy.</head>
               <p>IN the tyme of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as the Nouatian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes on the one ſide denyed, that ſuch as were once fallen,<note place="margin">Cyp. ep. <hi>55</hi> ad Cornel.</note> were to be receiued into the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon any tearmes whatſoeuer: ſo there were other heretikes who affirmed, that all were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, without any pennance, or ſatisfaction for their former ſinne. For the which cauſe S. Cyprian ſayth of them, that <hi>they endeauored, that ſinnes might not be redeemed by iuſt ſatisfaction &amp; lamentation: that wounds might not be waſhed by teares: That weeping and wayling might not be heard to proceed from the breſt, and from the mouth of ſuch as were fallen: that ſuch as were inuolued in defrauding, and deceyuing, or defyled with adultery, or polluted with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagion of ſacryfiee to Idols might not make confeſsion of their crymes in the Church; whereby all hope of ſatisfaction and pennance being taken away, they loſt both the ſenſe, and the fruit thereof.</hi> Which hereſy, whether it be reuiued by the Biſhop, or by thoſe congregations wherunto he hath vnited himſelfe, I ſhall leaue to your iudgment to conſider. But one of thoſe heretikes called <hi>Florentius Pupianus,</hi> writing vnto S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, as heere the Biſhop in the latter end of his booke addreſſeth his ſpeach to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pope, to giue them ſatisfaction, and to purge himſelfe of his proceeding againſt them, S.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7997:150"/>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> to abate his Pryde, &amp; to make him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it was the cauſe of the ſchiſme and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy wherinto he was fallen, vſeth theſe words among others, and ſayth. <hi>From hence Schiſmes and Hereſyes haue riſen, and do ariſe, becauſe the Biſhop which is one, and gouerneth the Church, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the proud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſome: and the man whome God hath vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chſafed to honour, is iudged of men to be vnworthy.</hi> And after a while he ſayth: <hi>There ſpeaketh Peter, vpon whom the Church was buylt, ſhewing, and teaching in the name of the Church: That albeit, the proud &amp; ſtifnecked mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe that would not obay, departed from Chriſt, yet the Church departeth not: wherefore thou oughteſt to know, ſayth he, that the Biſhop is in the Church, and the Church in the Biſhop: And ſo he who is not with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, is not in the Church;</hi> wherof he concludeth, that ſuch do <hi>flatter themſelues in vayne, who not hauing peace with the Prieſts of God, thinke it ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like words S. Cyprian vſeth in his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to Pope Cornelius, where he ſayth:<note place="margin">Cyp. lib. <hi>1.</hi> epiſt. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That there is no other cauſe of Hereſyes and Schiſmes, but that the Prieſt of God is not obayed: and that one Prieſt, and one Iudge is not acknowledged in the place of Chriſt, in the Church for the tyme.</hi> Where alſo hauing ſayd as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>that the Church was built vpon Peter,</hi> at length ſpeaking of the former Heretikes, that preſumed to go, and complaine of him to Pope Cornelius, he ſayth: <hi>That they were ſo audacious, as to ſayle vnto the Chayre of Peter, and to the principall Church, from whence the vnity of Prieſthood did proceed; not conſidering that they were Romans, whoſe fayth was prayſed by the mouth
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7997:151"/>of the Apoſtle, and vnto whome perfidiouſnes (or error in fayth) can haue no acceſſe.</hi> The like words againe he wrote in his Treatiſe of the vnity of the Church, where he ſayth: <hi>That men are tranſported by the Diuell, into Hereſy and Schiſme out of the Church of God, becauſe they do not returne to the origen of truth, nor ſeeke the head, nor follow the doctrine of their heauenly Maiſter. Which if they conſidered, there were no need of any long treatiſe or argument, but that the tryall of Fayth would be very eaſy.</hi> And then ſhewing what was this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly doctrine, and what the head, and origen of truth, which is taught vnto vs; he addeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly: <hi>Our Lord ſayd vnto Peter, I ſay vnto thee, thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke &amp;c. and vnto the ſame man after his reſurrection he ſayd: Feed my ſheep; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that our Sauiour built his Church vpon him alone, and committed vnto him his ſheep to be fed, and gaue him the Primacy, that there might be one Church &amp;c.</hi> And a little after he addeth: <hi>This vnity of the Church, he that doth not keep, doth he beleeue that he keepeth the Fayth? He that reſiſteth the Church, and striueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ſame, he that forſaketh the Chayre of Peter, doth he confide that he is in the Church?</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe els where he ſayth:<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>8.</hi> ad pleve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſam.</note> 
                  <hi>God is one, &amp; Chriſt one, and the Church one, and the Chayre one, built vpon Enter by the voyce of our Lord: any other Altar or new Prieſthood, beſide one Altar and one Priesthood cannot be erected and made.

                  <hi>SECTION XXXV.</hi> The concluſion of the Bishops booke, togeather with a short Concluſion of this whole Treatiſe.</head>
               <p>THERE remayneth only the concluſion of his booke; wherein, becauſe I haue wearied my
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7997:152"/>ſelfe too much already with ſweeping a way the cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs of his idle diſcourſe, whereunto in reſpect of the ſleightnes, and vnprofitablenes, and foulnes of the matter, the ſubſtance thereof may fitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; I will only note two or three things vnto you very briefly. Firſt therefore, as <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaluted Chriſt and ſayd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 14.45.</note> 
                  <hi>hayle Maiſter,</hi> and kiſſed him, whom a little before be had ſould to the Iewes as a falſe Prophet ſo the charity of this man is no leſſe to be obſerued and admired, in calling the Pope <hi>his most holy Father,</hi> and the Biſhops vnited with him, <hi>his moſt bleſſed Brethren,</hi> giuing them thereby his kiſſe of peace, whom before through all his booke, he had ſould to the Proteſtants for blind guydes, teaching innumerable errours, for corrupters of Gods word, tyrants, oppreſſors of the Church, Babylonians, and the like. Which termes, albeit no leſſe falſely, then impiouſly, they are applyed by him to the Pope and his Biſhops, whether you reſpect the former, wherein he ſhould ſhew his loue, or the later, wherein he expreſſeth his hatred vnto them yet becauſe, as it appeareth by his owne words, he deſcribeth therein his owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall kindred, it cannot be denyed, but that he is ready to acknowledge, if need were, the author of lyes himſelfe for his holy Father, and his wickedeſt children for his moſt bleſſed Brethren. Wherefore conſidering his zeale, wherof he boaſteth ſo much, to be ſo large, and the armes of his charity to be ſo far extended from Eaſt to Weſt, as to imbrace the fellowſhip of Babylon, which is the Citty of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; it is manifeſt that he excludeth neither Turks, nor Iufidells from his Communion. And therefore
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7997:152"/>me thinks, that as no good Proteſtant can be much delighted with it: ſo euery good Chriſtian ſhould abhorre and deteſt it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond poynt to be noted in his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is this, that he rather ordereth &amp; commaundeth, then aduiſeth the Pope <hi>to restore peace, and charity to all thoſe Churches, that profeſſe to receiue the eſſentiall Creeds of Fayth.</hi> By which he muſt needs meane, the three Creeds, of the Apoſtles, of the Councel of Nice againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> and of the Councell of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt <hi>Macedonius:</hi> and therefore ſuppoſeth all other poynts of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy, not contayned in thoſe Creeds to be matters indifferent, not ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyned, and not to be beleeued as articles of Fayth. Which is ſuch a monſtrous opinion, as doth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſhew him to be of no Religion at all: and therefore I maruell, how he could be ſuffered to publiſh ſuch wicked doctrine in England. For if the Pope muſt haue peace, and communion with all thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Creeds alone, howſoeuer they pleaſe to vnderſtand them; thereof it will follow, that all Councells, which haue beene celebrated ſince the making of thoſe Creeds, haue beene the authors of Schiſme and diſſention, in condemning later Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes, and that albeit a man ſhould deny al Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, yea and al Scripture at this day yet according to this Antichriſtian doctrine, it ſhould be Schiſme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, or to accompt him no good Chriſtian for the ſame And how eaſy a matter is it, not beleeuing the Scripture, to contemne the Creeds? or rather how impoſſible, contemning the one, to beleeue the other? This therefore may be another ſigne to be
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7997:153"/>added vnto thoſe, which I haue touched before, that the Biſhop being fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, is fallen likewiſe to Neutrality in Religion, &amp; may be a cauſe of greater miſchiefe, and of greater diſhonour to our Countrey, then they that feed him, haue yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in him.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit his incredible ignorance, which he diſcouereth, where among other poynts of idle Counſell, which he pleaſeth to beſtow vpon the Pope, and the reſt of the Biſhops of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church (himſelfe being ſo wyſe, as to admit no Counſell at all, neither from them, nor any other) he telleth them, that he will haue them belieue for certaine, that Schiſme in the Church is a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then Hereſy it ſelfe. Wherin it is to be admyred, how he could preſume to teach the whole Church ſuch a notable falſhood, with ſuch arrogant temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as heere he doth. For as he that hath no faith can haue no charity: ſo Hereſy, that deſtroyeth Faith, bringeth alſo ſchiſme with it, which is oppoſed to Charity. So that, albeit there may be ſchiſme in the Church without hereſy, as faith may remayne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charity: yet charity without faith, or hereſy without ſchiſme there cannot be. And therefore all Deuines haue euer held, that hereſy is far the greater miſchiefe, which bereaueth a man of all ſupernatural vertue, and maketh him worſe then an Infidell.</p>
               <p>The reſt of his concluſion is much of the ſame nature, wherein no leſſe inſolently then ignorantly, he taketh vpon him to ſchoole, and to catechize the Pope &amp; all his Prelates, preſcribing vnto them what they ought to belieue: and with what tearmes and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7997:153"/>conditions they may giue him ſatisfaction, &amp; make their peace and concord with him. Whereunto, I thinke no better anſwere can be giuen, in the Popes behalfe, then that which <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> made to <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pupianus,</hi> of whom we haue ſpoken before: for no man can be thought of, ſo fit as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to rebuke his Pryde, whom a little before vnder the colour of much reſpect, he ſo much abuſed. And in his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and inſolent behauiour towards the Pope, he doth ſo perfectly reſemble, the preſumptuous deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Pupianus</hi> towards S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyp. ep. <hi>65.</hi>
                  </note> as that the one ſeemeth to haue been but the figure of the other: the words therefore of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>What ſwelling Pryde is this? what arrogancy of hart? what inflation of mynd? to call vnto the trybunall of thy Iudgment the Prieſts</hi> (that is to ſay the Biſhops) <hi>and thoſe that are ſet ouer thee? that vnleſſe we can purge ourſelues to thee, and be abſolued by thy ſentence, now for ſo many yeares</hi> (for more then a thouſand) <hi>the Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity must be condemned to haue had no Biſhop, the people no Prelate, the flock no Paſtour, the Church no Gouernour, Chriſt no Antistes, and God no Prieſt. Let Pupianus</hi> (or Marcus Antonius) <hi>be pleaſed to help vs, let him giue his ſentence, and be contented to make good the iudgment of God &amp; of Chriſt, that ſo great a number of faythfull people ranged vnder vs, may not be thought to haue departed without hope of ſaluation: and that ſo many Nations of new beleeuers, be not accompted to haue receiued from vs no grace at all of the ſpirit of God: that the Communion, and reconcilement giuen by vs to ſo many that haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be not diſſolued, and taken from them by the authority of thy decree, vouchſafe at length to grant our requeſt,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7997:154"/>giue vs thy fauourable ſentence, confirme vs in our place by thy iudiciall authority, that God and his Christ may giue thee thanks; that by thee their Prelate is restored to their Alter againe, and their Rector to the gouernement of their people.</hi> Truly me thinks theſe words of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, being ſo applyable to your Biſhop as they are, ſhould make any man that ſeemeth to reſpect him, euen to bluſh, and to be aſhamed for him.</p>
               <p>And as concerning his Vertue of peace and concord, S. Cyprian in the ſame place doth anſwer him ſo fitly, as if he had penned the ſame directly for <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Florentius Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianus:</hi> For the which cauſe it being no way ſeemly for me, to adde any thing thereunto, I will make it the concluſion of this whole Treatiſe. <hi>Wherefore Brother</hi> (ſayth S. Cyprian) <hi>if thou wilt dayly conſider the Maieſty of God, from whome the ordinance of Priests proceedeth: If thou wilt beare reſpect vnto Chriſt, who with his holy pleaſure and continuall preſence gouerneth, both the Prelates themſelues, &amp; the Church with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; If thou wilt eſteeme of the innocency of Prieſts, not according to the hatred of man, but according to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: If thou wilt begin at length to repent thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity, and pride, and inſolency; If thou be contented to make a full and perfect ſatisfaction to God and his Chriſt, whome I ſerue, and vnto whome, with a pure and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate mouth, I offer continuall ſacrifice, both in peace &amp; perſecution: vpon theſe tearmes, we may be brought to haue peace, and communion with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, though I haue beene much longer, then I thought, yet at length, as I take it, I haue ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed, not only the little booke you ſent me, &amp; the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7997:154"/>other great volume, which it threatneth; but alſo the Author himſelfe. For I haue proued out of his own mouth, that in the whole courſe of his turning and flying from the Catholike Religion, there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſdome, nor humility, nor obedience; but only extreme confidence, pride, and preſumption in his owne wit, idle ſuſpitions, and iniurious ſurmyſes of fraud and falſhood in his own Maiſters, great ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with great ſignes of fearefull Apoſtaſy from that Order whereunto he was vowed, ſtrife &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with his Suffragans, hatred &amp; malice againſt the Pope who defended them, extreme ignorance, or extreme impudency in accuſing the Catholiks of innumerable errours, &amp; in affirming the Proteſtant Religion to be the doctrine of the Fathers, oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and moſt intemperate ſpeaches againſt the Pope his Superiour, and as, himſelfe calleth him, his moſt bleſſed Father, impious indifferency, and neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality in Religion, admiration of himſelfe and his booke, hypocriſy vnder the cloke of Charity. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh ſicophancy, and moſt vnchriſtian adulation, indiſcretion, falſhood, and diſhoneſty in producing the authority of S. Cyprian, ſo much againſt his own cauſe, againſt the truth of the ſtory, againſt himſelfe in that poynt, &amp; againſt the common and knowne doctrine of S. Cyprian to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And therfore to omit, that in this maiſter-peece of worke, which he made to gayne himſelfe credit, for the reſt of his books that are to follow, he proueth nothing, but euery where beggeth the queſtion, &amp; ſheweth to diſſent from the Proteſtants themſelues, whom he taketh vpon him to defend all
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7997:155"/>his former vertues, which I haue brieflly rehearſed, being put togeather, I thinke will be ſufficient to make any thing that ſhall come from his penne, to be vehemently ſuſpected, or altogeather deſpyſed hereafter. And truly theſe good qualityes of his, which I may call his prayſes, becauſe he hath no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do ſo manifeſt themſelues, in all the paſſages of his booke, to euery iudicious Reader, that there was little need of me, or of any other to haue beene his Brother.</p>
               <p>And now, that according as I affirmed in the beginning, you may perceiue the entrance of this ſtrange Biſhop into England, to haue beene no other, then the comming of a foule ſpanell to fawne vpon you, who can do no leſſe then beray you; I frame this Sillogiſme. <hi>The Diuell perſwadeth, or-indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth no man to forſake the falſe, or to imbrace the true Religion: But as hath been ſhewed, it was no other then the ſpirit of the Diuell, that induced the Biſhop to forſake the Catholike, and to imbrace the Proteſtant Religion: Therfore, neither the Catholike can be the falſe, nor the Proteſtant the true Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I had meant nothing els, but to diſcouer the ſpirit of this man, three or foure of the firſt Sections might haue ſufficed for the tryall thereof. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was deſirous, by this occaſion, to lay open and approue vnto you, ſome of the chiefeſt grounds of the Catholike Religion, by which your ſelues might eaſily refute whatſoeuer the ſame author may herafter publiſh in proſecution of his purpoſes, I went forward, and as the matter of his booke requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Firſt, I gaue you a full, and euident proofe of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7997:155"/>the Popes Supremacy. And ſecondly, I made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare moſt manifeſtly, that the auncient Fathers taught the ſame doctrine, which the Catholikes now profeſſe; and that they vtterly condemned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and were likewiſe condemned by them. And laſtly I haue ſhewed, that as the Proteſtants of their part, can giue no fundamentall reaſon of their faith, nor ſhew any ground thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue no fayth at all: ſo on the other ſide, I haue declared, that the motiues of the Catholike and of the Chriſtian Religion, are both the ſame, and be in themſelues moſt reaſonable, and moſt forceable to any mans iudgment or vnderſtanding, that ſhall duely conſider, or reflect vpon them. Which three poynts, being ſo clerely and manifeſtly proued, doe plainly conuince, that out of the Catholike Roman Church there is no ſaluation. Whereof, in ſeuerall places, I haue alſo declared the reaſons at large vnto you; becauſe that without obedyence vnto the Church, as I haue proued, there can neither be true fayth, nor true iuſtice; without both which, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that God ſhould be pleaſed; or the ſoule of man be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Wherefore conſidering, how ready and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous you haue alwayes profeſſed your ſelfe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, if euer you came to vnderſtand with whom it remayned; I will vſe no other perſwaſion, but only for a concluſion of my former diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Iren. l. <hi>4.</hi> cont. haer. cap. <hi>25.</hi>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7997:156"/>there we ought to learne the truth.

            <p>TRVTH is the daughter of tyme; and as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the beginning, it is good to expect the lame poſt, and the laſt newes is euer trueſt. Hauing ended this my Treatiſe, there came to my hands, a ſhort information of the life and manners of this our <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Biſhop (whome before out of his owne words I had ſufficiently diſcouered) taken authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and iuridically vnder the oathes and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes of many lawfull witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Whereby it appeareth, that he had no leſſe cauſe to feare the manifeſtation, and publication of his former lewdneſſe, then he diſcouereth in diuers places of his booke, to be exceeding iealous of ſuch a matter: many of the particulers related therin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo foule and abhominable, that modeſty, and good manners do not permit me to ſet them downe. For hauing byn lewdly brought vpin his youth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entred into Religion (which it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he concealed) after his Apoſtacy he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his vomit againe, and his old gift, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the words of our Sauiour, <hi>bringing ſeauen more with him, worſe then himſelfe, entred into him, and the laſt of this man was made farre worſe, then his foule beginning.</hi> And aſſure your ſelfe that nothing doth ſo much ſaue his good name (if he haue any among you) as the turpitude of his former life; wherein all men had rather it ſhould be buryed ſtill, then defile their pennes, themſelues, and the world with the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7997:157"/>diſcouery of it, except they be inforced to it.</p>
            <p>But becauſe among other heads of his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there is a poynt or two, which will declare by what meanes he attayned to thoſe titles of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall dignity, wherof he vaunteth ſo much, and from whence doth flow all the grace, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler reſpect which is giuen vnto him, of thoſe that do not know him; I thought it expedient to adde this ſhort addition, to the end they be not longer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, what a Saint they haue gotten to honour their cauſe, and what a pillar he is like to proue to ſupport their Religion.</p>
            <p>You ſhall therfore vnderſtand, that <hi>Segnia</hi> (which was his firſt Biſhopricke) is a little Citty, but moſt impregnable, vpon the Confines of <hi>Germany</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy;</hi> the people wherof (commonly called <hi>Iſcocehi</hi>) do neither plow nor plant for their ſuſtenance, nor card nor ſpin for their cloathing, nor trade with other Nations by way of merchandize, but liue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather vpon ſpoyle, either of the Turkes, which is their profeſſion, or els of Chriſtians, when they pleaſe to miſtake the one for the other. In which reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, it is eaſier to find thoſe that would refuſe (if they were either wiſe or honeſt) then ſuch as would willingly accept the Eccleſiaſtcall gouerment of this Martiall people.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to come to our purpoſe; it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the information aforſayd, that the Biſhop of <hi>Segnia</hi> being ſlaine in ſome enterpize of warre, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g certaine ſoldiars of the Emperour, with whom he was in company, <hi>Marcus Antonius de Dominis;</hi> who was then a Ieſuit in profeſſion, though not in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7997:157"/>purpoſe, but deſirous to be at liberty, forged letters from the friends and kindred of the late Biſhop to himſelfe, as to their kinſman (which as it ſeemeth he was not) ſignifying, that the Biſhop was not ſlayne, but taken priſoner, and entreating him to come to <hi>Segnia,</hi> from whence he might worke ſome meanes to ſet him at liberty. Vpon the credit of which let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his Superiours (as it ſhould ſeeme) gaue him leaue to go thither, where firſt he obtained to ſupply the place of the late deſceaſed Biſhop, &amp; afterwards to be made Biſhop himſelfe. Which Epiſcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as he got by forgery, and Apoſtaſy from his owne Order ſo he behaued himſelfe accordingly, in the adminiſtration therof. For he had his part (if not his hand) in the prey with the ſouldiars of that place, became a pot companion with them, and in how ſing and got m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And taking occaſion to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> he wrot backe to the <hi>Iſcocchi</hi> his goſtly children, that he had made their peace with the <hi>Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> &amp; that they might ſafely ſayle in the Venetian ſeas: vpon which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance fourty of them ſayling to wards Turky, were intrapped, and ſlaine by the Venetian ſouldiars, at a certaine <hi>

               </hi> where they fell into the ſnare, which their reuerend Father in God had layd for them.</p>
            <p>Of which bloudy treachery, this audacious Prelate, <hi>being come to the prefoundnes of iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. <hi>1863.</hi>
               </note> was
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7997:158"/>ſo little aſhamed, as he was accuſtomed to boaſt of his ſeruice therein done to the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice;</hi> ſaying, that if the <hi>Iſcocchi</hi> could lay hands of him, they would make a bagge of his skin (as they are accuſtomed to make of Swines skins, for wine and oyle in thoſe countryes,) and that he expected the firſt good Biſhopricke, which might fall in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhould be giuen him for his deſert. And ſo (as it ſeemeth) in recompence of this his ſeruice, and expectation of the like when occaſion ſhould be offered for policy of State, the Church of <hi>Spalato</hi> was giuen him, which though poore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenews, yet in reſpect of the Metropolitan dignity, was fit to ſatisfy his ambition.</p>
            <p>By this you may ſee, how truly, and litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that ſaying is verified of the Church of <hi>Segnia</hi> vnder his Cure, which falſely and impudently he applyeth to the Church of Chriſt vnder the Pope, affirming, <hi>that it was become a vinyeard to make Noe drunke, and a flocke which the Paſtour did ouermilke, and not only ſheer and ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Wherein the greiuouſneſſes of his ſinne may be compared to the ſinne of <hi>Iudas Iudas</hi> betrayed the innocent bloud of Chriſt, vnder the ſhew of peace for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; this ſecond <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner the innocent bloud of fourty Chriſtians his ſpiritual children, not for mony, but for ſpiritual preferment, which of all other things being moſt oppoſite to the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7997:158"/>ſheeding of innocent bloud, was a far fouler Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; more damnable price therof, then any money could be. And whereas <hi>Iudas</hi> repented him of his ſinne, and threw the money from him: this other <hi>Iudas</hi> did glory in his cryme, and as yet boaſteth of his dignity, being the vniuſt reward of ſo barbarous a treachery.</p>

               </note> compareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and ſpeaketh of his great zeale, as if it had brought him into a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of his Charity, as if it put him in danger to burſt with crying. And this he doth with ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his owne worth, &amp; with ſuch authority, as one may plainly ſee, that he aſſureth himſelf not only to be able to deceiue you in the opinion of his hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but to giue rules of beleef, and a law of Religion like a new Prophet ſent from God to all the world about you. Wherein you may chooſe, whether you

            <p>But the iudgment of God hath ouertaken him, and that which he feared, is come vpon him. For not only he is become reprobate in ſenſe; but alſo the little wit and learning he had, ſeemeth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him.
